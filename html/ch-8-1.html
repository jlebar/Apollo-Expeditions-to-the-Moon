Footprints on the plain at Hadley, beneath the 
unearthly Apennines, were made by men who
had walked the long path of astronaut selection 
and training. To be one of the dozen men who
have so far walked the Moon was to have survived 
close screening for physical and mental
excellence, and to have emerged successfully from long, 
intensive, and often competitive training.

On a June day in 1965, following their spectacular Gemini 4 flight, James
McDivitt and Edward White flew up to Washington from Houston with their wives
and children. The helicopter bearing them from Andrews Air Force Base, Md., had no
sooner settled on the White House lawn than Lady Bird Johnson said she wanted them
all to spend the night; babysitters would be provided. The two astronauts heard the
President call them "Christopher Columbuses of the twentieth century", and he pronounced 
the United States now caught up with the Russians.
<br><br>
The two astronauts had a parade. They lunched with Vice President Humphrey
and congressional leaders, and in the evening they went to the State Department for a
reception. Before a packed assemblage of foreign diplomats they showed a 20-minute
movie of their flight, which included the first American walk in space by Ed White.
<br><br>
In strode Lyndon B. Johnson himself, who told McDivitt and White, "I want you
to join our delegation in Paris." Furthermore, the President wanted them to go now,
as soon as they and their wives could pack. He was seething because the Russians had
humbled the Americans at the Paris Air Show, where Yuri Gagarin was standing by
his spacecraft, shaking hands with everybody and passing out Vostok pins. The French
press noted that the lackluster American pavilion was shunned by the crowds.
<br><br>
Patricia McDivitt and Patricia White wailed in unison, "But we have nothing to
wear!" Never mind, said LBJ, Lady Bird and Lynda Bird and Luci have plenty of
clothes. The ladies retired to the White House bedrooms, and the two Pats were duly
outfitted. Long after midnight the Presidential plane took off, bearing as additional
passengers Hubert Humphrey, James Webb, and Charles Mathews, the Gemini program 
manager.
<br><br>
The astronauts made it only in time for the last day and a half of the eleven-day
show, but they gave the Russians some real competition. Wherever they appeared, the
American <i>jumeaux de space</i> were followed by masses 
of Frenchmen. "A partial recovery for the United States" was the Paris 
newspapers' verdict.

Such were the glory days, when to be an astronaut was to be in heaven - if one
could endure the slavery that was the obverse of the coin.
Altogether there were seven groups of astronauts, a total of 73, of whom 43 flew
before the long night settled on manned space flight after the Apollo-Soyuz mission in
July 1975. Twenty-nine of these filled the 33 slots in Apollo, 
with which we are principally concerned here.
<br><br>
What did it take to become an astronaut? Dr. Robert Voas, a psychologist who
was the Mercury astronauts' training director, detailed the required characteristics as
he saw them: intelligence without genius, knowledge without inflexibility, a high degree
of skill without overtraining, fear but not cowardice, bravery without foolhardiness,
self-confidence without egotism, physical fitness without being muscle-bound, a preference 
for participatory over spectator sports, frankness without blabbermouthing, enjoyment 
of life without excess, humor without disproportion, fast reflexes without panic
in a crisis. These ideals were fulfilled to a high degree.
