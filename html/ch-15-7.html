The oldest photograph of lunar details on record.  
The original of this picture was a "Crystalotype" print 
made from a daguerreotype taken in March 1851.  As in all 
telescopic views of the half Moon, relief features are visible 
only near the terminator.  The remainder of the image shows 
only the contrast in reflectivity between the maria and the 
highlands.

Space photography over a vast range of scales is providing 
the raw material for many kinds of study.  This view of the 
almost-full lunar disk was taken when Apollo 17 was about 
2000 miles from the Moon on its way home.  More than a third 
of the area covered is never visible from the Earth.  
Mare Smythii, the dark circular area just to the right of 
the center, straddles the 90' east meridian.  The crater 
Tsiolkovsky is near the terminator at the lower right.

This southward-looking oblique view from an orbital altitude 
of 70 miles places lunar features in a new perspective.  
The crater in the center is Aristarchus, the brightest 
large crater an the Moon. It is 25 miles in diameter and 
2 1/4 miles deep. The low Sun angle has brought into bald 
relief the deposits of ejected material, as well as the strange 
sinuous rilles.

At one point on its coasting path toward the Moon, Apollo 17
lined up with the Sun and the Earth, enabling the astronauts to take
this full-disk view. Since it was December, the beginning of summer
in the Southern Hemisphere, the icecap that covers the Antarctic
continent is brightly illuminated. A most striking feature of the
visible land mass of Africa and southeastern Asia is the transition
from the tawny color of the Sahara, Libyan, and Arabian deserts,
through the dark band of grass-covered savannah, to the cloud-strewn
tropical rain forest.

<h4>Shown us mysterious super-canyons on Mars ...</h4>

A complex of huge valleys and tributary canyons, now named the 
Valles Marineris, can be traced across 2500 miles of the Martian 
surface. It is comparable in scale to the Red Sea or the east 
African rift valley system and probably originated, like them, 
in the pulling part of great plates of the planetary crust.  
Tectonic activity of this kind marks a planet that is still 
evolving. The tree-like tributary canyons in the picture 
(a 275-mile segment of Valles Marineris) may be the result of 
water erosion, even though the Martian atmosphere now contains 
little water.

Cloud tops high in the atmosphere form the giant planet's 
visible surface.  This photograph, produced from the red and 
blue digital images of Pioneer 11's imaging photopolarimeter, 
shows the characteristic banding parallel to the equator and 
the elongated circles that mark regions of intense vertical 
convective activity.  Most prominent among these is the Great 
Red Spot, a hurricane-like group of thunderstorms that has 
persisted through several centuries of observation.  
Jupiter's weather systems are long-lived because their 
heat comes mainly from the planet's liquid interior.

<h4>Revealed atmospheric circulations on overheated Venus ...</h4>

Clouds in its very dense atmosphere completely hide Venus' solid 
surface. Although the clouds are nearly featureless at visible 
wavelengths, they show a wealth of detail in the near ultraviolet.  
This ultraviolet picture, taken by the Mariner 10 television camera, 
is one of a post-encounter sequence that shows the cloud-bearing 
atmospheric layer in retrograde (right to left) rotation with a 
four-day period.  The swirling currents of that rotation interact 
with convection cells rising from the subsolar point near the left 
edge of the disk.

<h4>Unveiled the scarred, pocked face of Mercury ...</h4>

The surface of Mercury was revealed to science on March 29, 1974, 
when Mariner 10 took over 1600 television frames just before 
and just after flying past the planet's dark side.  
The left and right halves of this picture are mosaics of 
the pre-encounter and post-encounter frames. A second 
encounter, six months later, provided additional coverage.  
Although the crater interiors on this airless planet closely 
resemble those on the Moon, study of the highresolution frames 
shows external differences that may result from Mercury's stronger 
gravity field.

We shall have to wait a few more years for a closer view of 
Saturn and its rings. Pioneer 11 will encounter the planet 
in September 1979.  Saturn is second in size only to Jupiter, 
with an average density less than that of water. Titan, the 
largest of its ten satellites, is the only one in the solar 
system known to have an appreciable atmosphere. Saturn's rings 
are thin layers of separate particles orbiting in its equatorial 
plane. The ring system is probably less than 60 miles thick, 
and its total mass is very small compared to that of Saturn's 
satellites.
