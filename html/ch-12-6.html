<h3>THE HUNT FOR THE RIM OF CONE</h3>

Another problem was that the ruggedness and unevenness of
the terrain made it very hard to navigate by landmarks, which is
the way a man on foot gets around. Ed and I had difficulty in
agreeing on the way to Cone, just how far we had traveled, and
where we were. We did some more sampling. and then moved on
toward Cone, into terrain that had almost continuous undulations,
and very small flat areas. Soon after that, the surface began to
slope upward even more steeply, and it gave us the feeling that
we were starting the last climb to the rim of Cone. We passed a
rock which had a lot of glass in it, and reported to Houston that
it was too big to pick up.
<br><br>
We continued, changing our suit cooling rated to match our
increased work output as we climbed. and stopping a couple of
times briefly to rest. For a while, we picked up the cart and
carried it, preferring to move this way because it was a little
faster.

And then came what had to be one of the most frustrating
experiences on the traverse. We thought we were nearing the rim
of Cone, only to find we were at another and much smaller crater
still some distance from Cone. At that point, I radioed Houston
that our positions were doubtful, and that there was probably
quite a way to go yet to reach Cone.
<br><br>
About then, there was a general concurrence that maybe that
was about as far as we should go, even though Ed protested that
we really ought to press on and look into Cone crater. But in the
end, we stopped our traverse short of the lip and turned for the
walk back to Antares.
<br><br>
Later estimates indicated we were perhaps only 30 feet or so
below the rim of the crater, and yet we were just not able to
define it in that undulating and rough country.
<br><br>
One of the rocks we sampled in that area was a white breccia
(a rock made up of pieces of stone embedded in a matrix). The
white coloring came from the very high percentage of feldspar
that was in the breccia. That rock, and others in the area, were
believed to approach 4.6 billion years in age.

The RTG was the powerhouse for the entire experiment
package. The temperature difference between the fuel
capsule and the finned outer housing was converted into
electrical power by 442 lead telluride thermocouples.
Starting at about 74 watts, the output to the central station 
will continue for years at a slowly diminishing rate.

<br>

We stopped at Weird crater, for more sampling and some
panoramic photography, and then continued the return traverse. At
the Triplet craters, more than three-quarters of the way back to
Antares, we stopped again. Ed's job there was to drive some core
tubes; I was to dig a trench to check the stratification of the
surface. But the core material was granular and slipped out of
the tube every time Ed lifted it clear of the surface. I wasn't
having any better luck with my trenching, because the side walls
kept collapsing. I did get enough of a trench dug so that I could
observe some stratification of the surface materials, seeing
their color shift into the darker browns and near blacks, and
then into a surprisingly light-colored layer underneath the
darkest one.
<br><br>
That was it, Antares was in sight, as it had been throughout
much of the traverse, and our long Moon walk was almost over. I
went on past Antares to the ALSEP site to check antenna alignment
because of reports from Houston that a weak signal was being
received. Ed took some more samples from a nearby field of
boulders.

With its three gold-covered booms outspread, the
Lunar Surface Magnetometer can measure the three
orthogonal components of the magnetic field. Periodically, 
the fluxgate sensors at the ends of the booms
are flipped over mechanically to check the calibration.
An astronaut initially oriented the instrument by means
of the shadowgraph shown at the base of the X-axis
(right) boom and the bubble level on the sunshade.

The Laser Ranging Retroreflector (LRRR) is a completely 
passive array of small fused-silica corner
cubes that reflect incident light precisely back toward
its sources. When the source is a pulsed ruby Laser
at a large telescope, the distance from the LRRR to
the ground station can be routinely measured within
6 inches. The three LRRR arrays on the Moon permit
long-term studies of subtle Earth and Moon motions.

At that, our surface tasks were done, with the exception of
recovering the solar-wind experiment and getting back into
Antares for the return flight. We had covered a distance of about
two miles and collected many samples during four and one-half
hours on the surface in the second EVA. I also threw a makeshift
javelin, and hit a couple of golf shots.

A leveling head on the antenna mast permitted the

of the three Ion Detector look angles permits study of
the directional characteristics of the flow of ions an
both sides of the Earth's magnetospheric tail.

After liftoff there were still experiments left to do. The
first of these was another seismic event, generated by the impact
of the jettisoned Antares on the Moon. Again the Moon responded
with that resonant ringing for some time after the event. Once we
were on our way back to Earth, we did a series of four
experiments in weightlessness. One was a simple metal casting
experiment, to see what the effects of zero gravity would be on
the purity or the homogeneity of the mass. The materials included
some pure samples, and others with crystals or fibers for
strengthening. As you might expect, the materials turned out to
be more homogeneous under zero-gravity conditions. We measured
heat flow and convection in some samples and, sure enough, zero
gravity changed those characteristics also. We did some
electrophoretic separations, which are techniques used by the
pharmaceutical industry to make vaccines, in the belief that
maybe zero-gravity conditions could simplify a complex and
expensive process. Finally, we did some fluid transfer
experiments, simply trying to pour a fluid from one container to
another in zero gravity. The surface tension works against you
there, and so it was much easier when the containers being used
were equipped with baffles that the fluid could cling to, as it
were.

The Passive Seismic Experiment is completely hidden 
by its many-layered shroud of aluminized
Mylar. The top of the thermal shroud is the platform 
for the bubble level and Sun compass that
the astronaut used to orient the experiment initially. 
An internal set of leveling motors keeps the
seismometers constantly level within a few seconds of arc. 
Seismic motions are recorded on
Earth with a magnification factor of 10 million. 
The network created by the four ALSEPs that
have this experiment enables seismologists to 
locate moonquakes in three dimensions, and to
study the seismic velocities and propagation 
characteristics of subsurface materials.

That was our mission. Our return was routine, our landing on
target, and our homecoming as joyous as those before.
<br><br>
I look back now on the flights carrying Pete's crew and my
crew as the real pioneering explorations of the Moon. Neil, Buzz,
and Mike in Apollo 11 proved that man could get to the Moon and
do useful scientific work, once he was there. Our two flights-
Apollo 12 and 14- proved that scientists could select a target
area and define a series of objectives, and that man could get
there with precision and carry out the objectives with relative
ease and a very high degree of success. And both of our flights.
as did earlier and later missions, pointed up the advantage of
manned space exploration. We all were able to make minor
corrections or major changes at times when they were needed,
sometimes for better efficiency, and sometimes to save the
mission.

Like any tourist in a strenge place, Ed Mitchell consults a map on
his way to Cone crater. He was photographed by his companion, Alan
Shepard, during the second Apollo 14 EVA. During their 9 hours on
the lunar surface, these tourists collected 95 pounds of lunar samples
to bring home. Their main complaint during their stay was the way
the lunar dust stuck to their suits almost up to their knees.

Apollo 12 and 14 were the transition missions. After us came
the lunar rover, wheels to extend greatly the distance of the
traverse and the quantity of samples that could be carried back
to the lunar module. And on the last flight, a trained scientist
who was also an astronaut went along on the mission.
<br><br>
I'd like to look on that last flight as just a temporary
hold in the exploration of space.

flying. Who knows how many thousands
of years will pass before a wind of vaporized 
rock from some nearby meteorite impact 
once more sets this flag flapping?

In the blackness of space, the Apollo 14
command-service module Kitty Hawk
gleams brilliantly as it draws near the
camera in the lunar module Antares. The
single-orbit rendezvous procedure, used
for the first time in lunar orbit on this mission, 
brought the two craft together in two
hours. After crew transfer, Antares was
guided to lunar impact at a point between
the Apollo 12 and 14 sites. The resulting
seismic signal, recorded by both instruments, 
lasted 1 1/2 hours.

At its journey's end, the Apollo 14 command
module splashes down into the sparkling South
Pacific, some 900 miles south of Samoa. The
parachutes collapse as they are freed of their
load. On this occasion, the command module remained 
right side up in the water after landing.
Like a kayak, a command module was just as
stable in the water when it was upside-down
(stable two). If it toppled over to an inverted
position, as happened on other splashdowns,
the crew could right it by means of inflatable
airbags.

routinely lashed an inflated flotation collar

The veritable pay dirt of the Apollo expeditions 
is the collection of lunar samples that is now
available for the most detailed examination and analysis. 
Scientists have long been aware that
our understanding of the nature and history of the 
solar system has been biased in unknown ways
by the fact that all of the study material comes 
from one planet. Although meteorites are fascinating 
samples of the material of the solar system at large, 
there is never any direct evidence of the
source of an individual meteorite. Now, within a few 
years, mankind has assembled the material
of another world, recording where each piece 
came from and what was nearby. Here, scientists
at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory work with an 
Apollo 14 sample in a sterile nitrogen atmosphere.
