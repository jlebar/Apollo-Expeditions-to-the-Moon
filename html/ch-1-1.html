<h2>A Perspective on Apollo</h2>

<h4>By JAMES E. WEBB</h4>
<br>

After hundreds of thousands of years of occupancy, and several thousand years
of recorded history, man quite suddenly left the planet Earth in 1969 to fly to 
its nearest neighbor, the Moon. The ten-year span it took to accomplish this task 
was but a blink of an eye on an evolutionary scale, but the impact of the event will 
permanently affect man's destiny.

<font size=4><i>THE ARTIST LOOKS AT SPACE<br><br>
Dozens of America's artists were invited by NASA Administrator James E. Webb to
record the strange new world of space. Although an intensive use of photography 
had long characterized NASA's work, the Agency recognized the special ability of 
the artist's eye to select and interpret what might go unseen by the literal 
camera lens.

No civilian  government agency had ever sponsored as comprehensive and 
unrestricted an art program before. A sampling of the many paintings and drawings 
that resulted is presented in this chapter.

In reflecting on the Apollo program, I am sometimes overwhelmed at the sheer
magnitude of the task and the temerity of its undertaking. When Apollo was conceived,
a lunar landing was considered so difficult that it could only be accomplished through
exceptional large-scale efforts in science, in engineering, and in the development 
of operational and training systems for long-duration manned flights. These clearly 
required the application of large resources over a decade.
<br><br>
Industry, universities, and government elements had to be melded into a team of
teams. Apollo involved competition for world leadership in the understanding and
mastery of rocketry, of spacecraft development and use, and of new departures of 
international cooperation in science and technology. Like the Bretton Woods monetary
agreement, President Truman's Point Four Program, and the Marshall Plan, the Apollo
program was a further attempt toward world stability - but with a new thrust.
<br><br>
This chapter will review the origins of this policy and how it was successfully 
implemented. Subsequent chapters describe how particular problems were solved, how 
the astronauts and other teams of specialists were trained and performed, how the 
giant spaceboosters were built and flown, and how all this was joined together in a 
fully integrated effort. In many of these essays you will find indications of the 
meaning of the Apollo program to those who devoted much of their lives to it.

In the pre-space years the main defensive shield of the free world against 
Communist expansion was the preeminence of the United States in aeronautical 
technology and nuclear weaponry. These were an integral part of a system of 
mutual-defense treaties with other non-Communist nations.
