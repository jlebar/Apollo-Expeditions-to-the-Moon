In Mission Control the Gold Team, directed by Gerald Griffin
(seated, back of head to camera), prepares to take over from
Black Team (Glynn Lunney, seated, in profile) during a critical
period. Seven men with elbows on console are Deke Slayton,
Joe Kerwin (Black CapCom), Vance Brand (Gold CapCom),
Phil Shaffer (Gold FIDO), John Llewellyn (Black RETRO),
Charles Deiterich (Gold RETRO), and Lawrence Canin (Black GNC).
Standing at right is Chester Lee, Mission Director from
NASA's Washington headquarters, and broud back at right belogs to
Rocco Petrone, Apollo Program Director. Apollo 13 had two other
"ground" teams, the White and the Maroon. All devised heroic
measures to save the mission from disaster.

Since Apollo 13 many people have asked me, "Did you have
suicide pills on board?" We didn't, and I never heard of such a
thing in the eleven years I spent as an astronaut and NASA
executive.
<br><br>
I did, of course, occasionally think of the possibility that
the spacecraft explosion might maroon us in an enormous orbit
about the Earth - a sort of perpetual monument to the space
program. But Jack Swigert, Fred Haise, and I never talked about
that fate during our perilous flight. I guess we were too busy
struggling for survival.
<br><br>
Survive we did, but it was close. Our mission was a failure
but I like to think it was a successful failure.
<br><br>
Apollo 13, scheduled to be the third lunar landing, was
launched at 1313 Houston time on Saturday, April 11, 1970; I had
never felt more confident. On my three previous missions, I had
already logged 572 hours in space, beginning with Gemini 7, when
Frank Borman and I stayed up 14 days- a record not equaled until
Skylab.
<br><br>
Looking back, I realize I should have been alerted by
several omens that occurred in the final stages of the Apollo 13
preparation. First, our command module pilot, Ken Mattingly, with
whom Haise and I had trained for nearly two years, turned out to
have no immunity to German measles (a minor disease the backup LM
pilot, Charlie Duke, had inadvertently exposed us to). I argued
to keep Ken, who was one of the most conscientious, hardest
working of all the astronauts. In my argument to Dr. Paine, the
NASA Administrator, I said, "Measles aren't that bad, and if Ken
came down with them, it would be on the way home, which is a
quiet part of the mission. From my experience as command module
pilot on Apollo 8, I know Fred and I could bring the spacecraft
home alone if we had to." Besides, I said, Ken doesn't have the
measles now, and he may never get them. (Five years later, he
still hadn't.)
<br><br>
Dr. Paine said no, the risk was too great. So I said in that
case we'll be happy to accept Jack Swigert, the backup CMP, a
good man (as indeed he proved to be, though he had only two days
of prime-crew training).
<br><br>
The second omen came in ground tests before launch, which
indicated the possibility of a poorly insulated supercritical
helium tank in the LM's descent stage. So we modified the flight
plan to enter the LM three hours early, in order to obtain an
onboard readout of helium tank pressure. This proved to be lucky
for us because it gave us a chance to shake down this odd-shaped
spacecraft that was to hold our destiny in its spidery hands. It
also meant the LM controllers were in Mission Control when they
would be needed most.
<br><br>
Then there was the No. 2 oxygen tank, serial number 10024X-TA0009. 
This tank had been installed in the service module of
Apollo 10, but was removed for modification (and was damaged in
the process of removal). I have to congratulate Tom Stafford,
John Young, and Gene Cernan, the lucky dogs, for getting rid of
it.
<br><br>
This tank was fixed, tested at the factory, installed in our
service module. and tested again during the Countdown
Demonstration Test at the Kennedy Space Center beginning March
16, 1970. The tanks normally are emptied to about half full, and
No. 1 behaved all right. But No. 2 dropped to only 92 percent of
capacity. Gaseous oxygen at 80 psi was applied through the vent
line to expel the liquid oxygen, but to no avail. An interim
discrepancy report was written, and on March 27, two weeks before
launch, detanking operations were resumed. No. 1 again emptied
normally, but its idiot twin did not. After a conference with
contractor and NASA personnel, the test director decided to "boil
off" the remaining oxygen in No. 2 by using the electrical heater
within the tank. The technique worked, but it took eight hours of
65-volt DC power from the ground-support equipment to dissipate
the oxygen.
<br><br>
With the wisdom of hindsight, I should have said, "Hold it.
Wait a second. I'm riding on this spacecraft. Just go out and
replace that tank." But the truth is, I went along, and I must
share the responsibility with many, many others for the $375
million failure of Apollo 13. On just about every spaceflight we
have had some sort of failure, but in this case, it was an
accumulation of human errors and technical anomalies that doomed
Apollo 13.
<br><br>
At five and a half minutes after liftoff, Swigert, Haise,
and I felt a little vibration. Then the center engine of the S-II
stage shut down two minutes early. This caused the remaining four
engines to burn 34 seconds longer than planned, and the S-IVB
third stage had to burn nine seconds longer to put us in orbit.
No problem: the S-IVB had plenty of fuel.
<br><br>
The first two days we ran into a couple of minor surprises,
but generally Apollo 13 was looking like the smoothest flight of
the program. At 46 hours 43 minutes Joe Kerwin, the CapCom on
duty, said, "The spacecraft is in real good shape as far as we
are concerned. We're bored to tears down here." It was the last
time anyone would mention boredom for a long time.
<br><br>
At 55 hours 46 minutes, as we finished a 49-minute TV
broadcast showing how comfortably we lived and worked in
weightlessness, I pronounced the benediction: "This is the crew
of Apollo 13 wishing everybody there a nice evening, and we're
just about ready to close out our inspection of Aquarius (the LM)
and get back for a pleasant evening in Odyssey (the CM). Good
night."
<br><br>
On the tapes I sound mellow and benign, or some might say
fat, dumb, and happy. A pleasant evening, indeed! Nine minutes
later the roof fell in; rather, oxygen tank No. 2 blew up,
causing No. 1 tank also to fail. We came to the slow conclusion
that our normal supply of electricity, light, and water was lost,
and we were about 200,000 miles from Earth. We did not even have
power to gimbal the engine so we could begin an immediate return
to Earth.
<br><br>
The message came in the form of a sharp bang and vibration.
Jack Swigert saw a warning light that accompanied the bang, and
said, "Houston, we've had a problem here." I came on and told the
ground that it was a main B bus undervolt. The time was 2108
hours on April 13.
<br><br>
Next, the warning lights told us we had lost two of our
three fuel cells, which were our prime source of electricity. Our
first thoughts were ones of disappointment, since mission rules
forbade a lunar landing with only one fuel cell.
<br><br>
With warning lights blinking on, I checked our situation;
the quantity and pressure gages for the two oxygen tanks gave me
cause for concern. One tank appeared to be completely empty, and
there were indications that the oxygen in the second tank was
rapidly being depleted. Were these just instrument malfunctions?
I was soon to find out.
<br><br>
Thirteen minutes after the explosion, I happened to look out
of the left-hand window, and saw the final evidence pointing
toward potential catastrophe. "We are venting something out into
the- into space," I reported to Houston. Jack Lousma, the CapCom
replied, "Roger, we copy you venting." I said, "It's a gas of
some sort."
<br><br>
It was a gas-oxygen-escaping at a high rate from our
second, and last, oxygen tank. I am told that some amateur
astronomers on top of a building in Houston could actually see
the expanding sphere of gas around the spacecraft.
