<h3>TAN DUST ON SURVEYOR</h3>

We found some green rocks, and some gray soil that
maintained its light color even below the surface, which is not
common, and we finally reached the Surveyor crater. I was
surprised by its size and its hard surface. We could have landed
right there, I believe now, but it would have been a scary thing
at the time. The Surveyor was covered with a coating of fine
dust, and it looked tan or even brown in the lunar light, instead
of the glistening white that it was when it left Earth more than
two years earlier. It was decided later that the dust was kicked
up by our descent onto the surface, even though we were 600 feet
away.
<br><br>
We cut samples of the aluminum tubing, which seemed more
brittle than the same material on Earth, and some electrical
cables. Their insulation seemed to have gotten dry, hard, and
brittle. We managed to break off a piece of glass, and we
unbolted the Surveyor TV camera. Then Al suggested that we cut
off and take back the sampling scoop, and so we added that to the
collection.
<br><br>
Then we headed back to the Intrepid. We retrieved the solar-
wind experiment, stowed it and the sample bags in the Intrepid,
got in, buttoned it up, and started repressurization. Altogether
we brought back about 75 pounds of rocks, and 15 pounds of
Surveyor hardware. We also brought back the 25-pound color TV
camera from Intrepid so that its failure could be investigated.
<br><br>
While we were busy on the surface, Dick Gordon was busy in
lunar orbit. The Yankee Clipper was a very sophisticated
observation and surveying spacecraft. One of the experiments that
Dick performed was multispectral photography of the lunar
surface, which gave scientists new data with which to interpret
the composition of the Moon.
<br><br>
After Al and I got back to Yankee Clipper following lunar
liftoff and rendezvous, all three of us worked on the photography
schedule. We were looking specifically for good coverage of
proposed future landing sites, especially Fra Mauro, which was
then scheduled for Apollo 13. That's a rough surface, and we
wanted to get the highest resolution photos we could so that the
crew of the Apollo 13 mission would have the best training
information they could get.
<br><br>
We changed the plane of our lunar orbit to cover the sites
better, and we also elected to stay an extra day in lunar orbit
so that we could complete the work without feeling pressured. We
took hundreds of stills, and thousands of feet of motion-picture
film of the Fra Mauro site, and of the Descartes and Lalande
craters, two other proposed landing sites.
<br><br>
Meantime the experiments we had left on the lunar surface
were busy recording and transmitting data. They all worked well,
with one exception, and were really producing useful data. One
unexpected result came from the seismic experiment recording the
impact of Intrepid on the surface after we had jettisoned it. The
entire Moon rang like a gong, vibrating and resonating for almost
on hour after the impact. The best guess was that the Moon was
composed of rubble a lot deeper below its surface than anybody
had assumed. The internal structure, being fractured instead of a
solid mass, could bounce the seismic energy from piece to piece
for quite a while.
<br><br>
The same phenomenon was observed at two ALSEP stations when
the Apollo 14 crew jettisoned their lunar module Antares and
programmed it to crash between the Apollo 12 and 14 sites.
<br><br>
With every mission after Apollo 12, additional seismic
calibrations were obtained by aiming the Saturn S-IVB stage to
impact a selected point on the Moon after separation from the
spacecraft. The seismic vibrations from these impacts lasted
about three hours.

Color telecasts, live from the Apollo 14 site, 
came by way of the erectable S-band antenna
shown here. The S-band of radio frequencies 
(between 1550 and 5200 megahertz) was used for
high-data-rate space transmissions. The 
gold-colored parabolic reflector, which opened just like
an umbrella, provided a higher gain than 
the lunar module's own steerable antenna. Note how
featureless the lunar surface appears in 
the area just above the astronaut's shadow. This illustrates 
the visibility problem that the astronauts 
faced in walking down-Sun.

Apollo 13 was supposed to land in the Fra Mauro area. The
explosion on board wiped out that mission, and it became instead
a superb example of a crew's ability to turn a very risky
situation into a safe return to Earth.
<br><br>
So the Fra Mauro site was reassigned to Apollo 14, because
scientists gave that area a high priority. The following account
is by Alan B. Shepard, Jr., the first American into space and of
the original seven astronauts.
<br><br>
The Fra Mauro hills stand a couple of hundred of miles to
the cast of the Apollo 12 landing site. I was selected to command
this mission, my first since the original Mercury flight in 1961.
With me to the lunar surface went Edgar D. Mitchell in Antares,
while Stuart A. Roosa was the command module pilot of Kitty Hawk.
