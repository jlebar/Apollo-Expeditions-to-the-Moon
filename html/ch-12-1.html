Apollo 12 Astronaut Alan Bean examines Surveyor 
III's camera. The two astronauts
walked down to the spacecraft from their 
own lunar module, which they had landed about 600
feet away. They removed the TV camera and the 
scoop so that scientists could study the effects
on well-known materials of a 31-month lunar sojourn. 
A third spacecraft, Lunar Orbiter III, made
the pinpoint landing possible by its earlier feat 
of photographing the site in exquisite detail.

Scientific exploration of the Moon began in earnest with the
Apollo 12 and 14 missions. Four astronauts worked on the Moon in
four-hour shifts, walking from site to site. The Apollo 12
astronauts carried everything: experiments, equipment, tools,
sample hags, cameras. The Apollo 14 team had a small equipment
cart, and some of the time it was a help. But the missions showed
that a man in a pressurized suit had definite limitations on the
rugged and perplexing lunar surface. It was more work than it
seemed, and in the case of Apollo 14, medical advice from Earth
ended one phase of activity. But the two missions produced a
wealth of new scientific data and lunar samples, and both laid a
firm foundation for the great voyages of lunar exploration to
follow.
<br><br>
The sky was cloudy and rain was falling on November 14,
1969, as the Apollo 12 crew prepared for launch. Half a minute
after liftoff a lightning strike opened the main circuit breakers
in the spacecraft. Quick action by the crew and Launch Control
restored power, and Astronauts Charles "Pete" Conrad, Jr.,
Richard F. Gordon, and Alan L. Bean sped into sunlight above the
clouds. "We had everything in the world drop out", Conrad
reported. "We've had a couple of cardiac arrests down here too",
Launch Control radioed back.
<br><br>
Their destination was the Ocean of Storms. Four and a half
days later, Conrad and Bean entered the lunar module Intrepid and
separated from Gordon in the command module Yankee Clipper. Their
landing site was about 1300 miles west of where Apollo 11 had
landed, on a surface believed covered by debris splashed out from
the crater Copernicus some 250 miles away. The exact site was a
point where, 31 months before, the unmanned lunar scout Surveyor
III had made a precarious automatic landing. The Surveyor site
was a natural choice: it was a geologically different surface, it
would demonstrate pinpoint landing precision, and it would offer
a chance to bring back metal, electronic, and optical materials
that had soaked for many months in the lunar environment.
<br><br>
Here is Pete Conrad's account of the mission:
</i>
<br><br>
It was really pioneering in lunar exploration. We had
planned our traverses carefully, we covered them, and we stayed
on the time line. We had a real-time link with the ground, to
help guide our work on the surface. Of course we had practiced a
lot beforehand. working with geologists in the field to learn
techniques from them while they learned what we could and
couldn't do in the lunar environment.
<br><br>
Our first important task was the precision landing near
Surveyor III. When we pitched over just before the landing phase,
there it was, looking as if we would land practically on target.
The targeting data were just about perfect, but I maneuvered
around the crater, landing at a slightly different spot than the
one we had planned. In my judgment, the place we had prepicked
was a little too rough. We touched down about 600 feet from the
Surveyor. They didn't want us to be nearer than 500 feet because
of the risk that the descent engine might blow dust over the
spacecraft.
<br><br>
Our second important task- and of course the real reason for
going to the Moon in the first place- was to accomplish useful
scientific work on the surface. We had to set up the ALSEP and
its experiments; we had to do a lot of geologizing; and finally
we had to bring back some pieces of the Surveyor, so they could
be analyzed for the effects of their exposure.
<br><br>
Al Bean and I made two EVAs, each lasting just under four
hours; and we covered the planned traverses as scheduled. We
learned things that we could never have found out in a
simulation. A simple thing like shoveling soil into a sample bag,
for instance, was an entirely new experience. First, you had to
handle the shovel differently, stopping it before you would have
on Earth, and tilting it to dump the load much more steeply,
after which the whole sample would slide off suddenly.
