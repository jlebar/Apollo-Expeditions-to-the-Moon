<h3>A SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE</h3>

We would have died of the exhaust from our own lungs if
Mission Control hadn't come up with a marvelous fix. The trouble
was the square lithium hydroxide canisters from the CM would not
fit the round openings of those in the LM environmental system.
After a day and a half in the LM a warning light showed us that
the carbon dioxide had built up to a dangerous level, but the
ground was ready. They had thought up a way to attach a CM
canister to the LM system by using plastic bags, cardboard, and
tape- all materials we had on board. Jack and I put it together:
just like building a model airplane. The contraption wasn't very
handsome, but it worked. It was a great improvisation- and a fine
example of cooperation between ground and space.
<br><br>
The big question was, "How do we get back safely to Earth?"
The LM navigation system wasn't designed to help us in this
situation. Before the explosion, at 30 hours and 40 minutes, we
had made the normal midcourse correction, which would take us out
of a free-return-to-Earth trajectory and put us on our lunar
landing course. Now we had to get back on that free-return
course. The ground-computed 35-second burn, by an engine designed
to land us on the Moon, accomplished that objective 5 hours after
the explosion.

"Backroom" experts at Mission Control worked 
many hours to devise the fix that possibly kept the astronauts 
from dying of carbon dioxide. CapCom Joe Kerwin led 
Astronaut Swigert, step by step, for an hour to build a 
contraption like the one the experts had constructed on 
Earth. It involved stripping the hose from a lunar suit and 
rigging the hose to the taped-over CM double canister, 
using the suit's fan to draw carbon dioxide from the cabin 
through the canister and expel it back 
into the LM as pure oxygen.

Emergency scrubbers were built by Swigert and Haise.  
Photo above shows Swigert sitting next to a tapedover 
double canister and holding one 
end of a suit nozzle while Fred Haise 
used both his hands to manipulate the long hose.  
Underneath the canister is a "mailbox" built of arched 
cardboard, which was covered by a plastic bag. When Lovell 
later saw the rig put together on Earth, he said, 
"It looks just like the one we mode." It saved the 
astronauts from possible death from 
carbon dioxide.

As we approached the Moon, the ground informed us that we
would have to use the LM descent engine a second time; this time
a long 5-minute burn to speed up our return home. The maneuver
was to take place 2 hours after rounding the far side of the
Moon, and I was busy running down the procedures we were to use.
Suddenly, I noticed that Swigert and Haise had their cameras out
and were busy photographing the lunar surface. I looked at them
incredulously and said, "If we don't make this next maneuver
correctly, you won't get your pictures developed!" They said,
"Well, you've been here before and we haven't." Actually, some of
the pictures these tourists took turned out to be very useful.
<br><br>
It was about this time that I said, "Boys, take a good look
at the Moon. It's going to be a long time before anybody gets up
here again." Later on I was accused of sabotaging Apollo; poor
Dr. Paine had to explain that I didn't really mean it, and the
space program would go on. The Senate Space Committee asked me
about it a week after we got back. Actually, I didn't mean that
remark to be public. (I later learned that, unknown to us, we had
had a hot mike for about 45 minutes.) Nonetheless, it was 9
months before Apollo 14 was launched.
<br><br>
We had many crises on Apollo 13, but the biggest heart-
stopper has hardly been noticed, partly because the transcription
released to the press was garbled, and partly because there
wasn't much point in talking about a crisis that had been averted
earlier. It occurred prior to the second maneuver I mentioned
earlier; we called it P.C. + 2 (pericynthian 2 hours).
<br><br>
We had transferred the CM platform alignment to the LM. but
we had to make sure that this alignment was accurate before we
made the long P.C. + 2 burn. Ordinarily it is simple to look
through the sextant device, called the Alignment Optical
Telescope, find a suitable navigation star, and with the help of
our computer verify the guidance platform's alignment. But
traveling with us was a swarm of debris from the ruptured service
module. The sunlight glinting on these bits of junk- I called
them false stars- made it impossible to sight a real star.

Without a course correction, the returning spacecraft 
would have missed the Earth completely. Inertial references 
were stored in the guidance platform, but sightings 
an the Sun gave the astronauts confidence that 
the crucial burn would be properly oriented.

In the darkened, power-short spacecraft, 
temperature dropped to 38° F. Lovell and Haise 
donned their lunar 
boots, Swigert an extra suit of underwear. Water 
condensed on the cabin walls and windows frosted.  
Food was refrigerator-cold.

So what to do? If we couldn't verify the accuracy of the
alignment, we didn't have a way to make an accurate burn, or to
align the CM platform for reentry. In other words, the ground
would have no accurate way to tell us the correct attitude to
make the proper maneuvers to return home.
<br><br>
A genius in Mission Control came up with the idea of using
the Sun to check the accuracy of our alignment. No amount of
debris could blot out that star! Its large diameter could result
in considerable error, but nobody had a better plan.
<br><br>
I rotated the spacecraft to the attitude Houston had
requested. If our alignment was accurate, the Sun would be
centered in the sextant.

Haise dozes with his hands restrained to keep 
his weightless arms from flopping about.  
In the cold gloom, one 
crew member stayed on watch at all times.  
Stay-awake pills helped during the final 
hours as the Earth came 
whistling at them like a freight train.

When I looked through the AOT, the Sun just had to be there.
It really had to be. And it was. At 73:46 hours the air-to-ground
transcript sounds like a song from "My Fair Lady":
<br><br>
Lovell: O.K. We got it. I think we got it. What diameter was
it?
<br><br>
Haise: Yes. It's coming back in. Just a second.
<br><br>
Lovell: Yes, yaw's coming back in. Just about it.
<br><br>
Haise: Yaw is in....
<br><br>
Lovell: What have you got?
<br><br>
Haise: Upper right corner of the Sun....
<br><br>
Lovell: We've got it!
<br><br>
If we raised our voices, I submit it was justified.
<br><br>
I'm told the cheer of the year went up in Mission Control.
Flight Director Gerald Griffin, a man not easily shaken, recalls:
"Some years later I went back to the log and looked up that
mission. My writing was almost illegible I was so damned nervous.
And I remember the exhilaration running through me: My God,
that's kinds the last hurdle -- if we can do that, I know we can
make it. It was funny, because only the people involved knew how
important it was to have that platform properly aligned." Yet
Gerry Griffin barely mentioned the alignment in his change-of-
shift briefing -- "That check turned out real well" is all he said
an hour after his penmanship failed him Neither did we, as crew
members, refer to it as a crisis in our press conference nor in
later articles.
<br><br>
The alignment with the Sun proved to be less than a half a
degree off. Hallelujah Now we knew we could do the 5-minute P.C.
+ 2 burn with assurance, and that would cut the total time of our
voyage to about 142 hours. We weren't exactly home free: we had a
dead service module, a command module with no power, and a lunar
module that was a wonderful vehicle to travel home in, but
unfortunately didn't have a heat shield required to enter the
Earth's atmosphere. But all we needed now was a continuation of
the expertise we seemed blessed with, plus a little luck.
