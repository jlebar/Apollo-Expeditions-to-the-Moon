<h3>WHEN THE RED LIGHT LIT UP</h3> 
  
It was remarkable that every manned Apollo launch lifted off exactly on schedule,
up to the last one. (Apollo 14's forty-minute delay was due to weather.) But Apollo 17,
the only night launch, was delayed 2 hours and 40 minutes, until 12:33 a.m., because
of the failure of an automatic countdown sequencer in the ground equipment. The
way we had the launch set up was that the last three-minute period in effect was a series
of automatic commands, all done by a timer. If you didn't get through a certain gate
in the automatic sequencer the next command would not be given. This protected us
against a faulty liftoff.
<br><br>
This is what the term "terminal sequence" meant, which took a great deal of
check-out time in the months preceding launch. When we got down to 30 seconds
before lift-off, the indication of pressurization for one of the propellants in the S-IVB
stage hadn't registered, so the sequencer stopped the count. The red light on the overhead 
indicator in the firing room lit up. The engineer monitoring that read-out on the
strip chart told us the S-IVB was not pressurized. The ladder in the sequence wasn't
met, so we got a cut-off at 30 seconds.

The team went through a back-out act, as they had practiced, the arming command 
was withdrawn, the on-board batteries were taken off line, the radio-frequency
transmitters turned off, and within three or four minutes the space vehicle had been
returned to a status where we could safely hold. Everything was done very coolly, very
gingerly. Gene Cernan, the commander of the flight, said later that he kept his
hand - very tightly - on the abort switch, "because you never know". But once again
the launch escape tower went unused.
<br><br>
The problem turned out to be a faulty diode in the terminal sequencer. Among
the hundreds of commands given in sequence, one was not forthcoming, so everything
stopped - which is one of the marvels of Apollo. At this late date in the program
nobody batted an eye, including Walter J. Kapryan, the able engineer who had succeeded 
me as launch director when I went to Washington as Apollo Program Director
three years earlier.

the culmination of years of intense activity at the
Cape. In this wide-angle view from the press site, 
all eyes squint in the direction of the hot morning
Sun and the distant Launch Pad 39A, where the exhaust 
gases of the rocket's first stage have been
split by the flame deflector into two 
distinct columns of flame and smoke.

No story about the Cape - Canaveral, then Kennedy, then Canaveral again - would 
be complete without a mention of the visitors. By the time the Apollo program
ended in 1972 we had attracted more than 6 million of them, and that doesn't count
people who lined the roads and watched the lift-offs (there were a million of those, it
was estimated, for Apollo 11). We had VIP visitors in a steady stream - Presidents
of the United States, members of the Supreme Court, members of Congress, almost
any prominent person you could mention.
<br><br>
We had leaders from many countries - I recall the Shah of Iran, King Hussein of
Jordan (he was a jet pilot), the King of Afghanistan, King Baudoin of Belgium, Haile
Selassie of Ethiopia, Chancellor Erhard of Germany, and President Radhakrishnan
of India, who had been a professor of philosophy at Oxford. Other visitors included
foreign ministers and cabinet members from many countries. We talked to most of
them in informal sessions, explaining as best we could the mysteries of spaceflight.
The one visitor who impressed me most came in November 1963, and we briefed
him on a Saturn-Apollo unmanned mission due to fly in January - which would be
the first Saturn I to carry two stages (with a total of 14 engines, still the record for
launch vehicles). He promised to come back for the launch if he possibly could.
But he never made it because he was assassinated in Dallas six days later.
