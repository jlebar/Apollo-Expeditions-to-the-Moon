<h3>BENEFITS FROM SPACE TECHNOLOGY</h3>

No one can yet fully appraise the ultimate benefits from this historic achievement.
Many of the technical innovations necessary for men to go to the Moon and back have
already been embodied in everyday processes and products. These range from versatile
electronic computers to fireproof bedding in hospitals and special equipment for the
handicapped. More applications of information acquired from space research are 
continually being reported.

Possibly more significantly, the idea that if we can go to the Moon we can accomplish 
other feats long considered impossible has been firmly implanted in people's
minds. Confidence that solutions can be found to such urgent problems as an energy
shortage, environmental degradation, and strife between nations, has been nourished
by this spectacular demonstration in space of man's capabilities.
<br><br>
Apollo was a multidimensional success, triumphant not only as a feat of scientific
and engineering precision, but also as a demonstration of our country's spirit and
competence. In the worldwide reaction at the time of the lunar landing, it was clear
that this great adventure transcended nationality and became a milestone for mankind.
Every participant in the Apollo program saw a slightly different facet of it. While
reading these personal accounts and studying these pictures, you will possibly perceive
more clearly the motives, the hazards faced, and the triumphs that first enabled men
to set foot on the Moon.
