  <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
  <h3>FOREWORD</h3>

No nation ever demonstrated its aspirations and abilities as 
dramatically as did the United States when it landed the first men on 
the Moon, or as much in public: More people on Earth watched that first 
small step on a foreign planet than had witnessed any prior event in the 
ascent of man.  While it is still too early to assess the full 
significance of that remarkable undertaking, I think it is a good time 
to look back on the total enterprise, while the images are still sharp, 
and while those concerned are available to give testimony. Historians 
have observed that ventures into uncharted waters are often illuminated 
most vividly in the words of those who were there; one thinks of Caesar's 
<i>Commentaries</i>, Bradford's <i>History of Plymouth Plantation</i>, 
Darwin's <i>Voyage of the Beagle</i>. An interesting parallel exists 
between the voyages of <i>H.M.S. Beagle</i> and the missions of Apollo: 
One changed the course of the biological sciences, and the others are 
reshaping planetary and Earth sciences. In this volume you will find the 
personal accounts of eighteen men who, like Darwin, were much involved 
in long and influential voyages.

New scientific insights are an important part of the legacy of Apollo, 
as well as the worldwide lift to the human spirit that the achievement 
generated.  But there is a third legacy of Apollo that is particularly 
germane today. This was the demonstration that great and difficult 
endeavors can be conducted successfully by a steadfast mobilization of 
national will and resources. Today we face seemingly intractable
problems whose resolution may call for similar mobilization of resources 
and will. Husbanding the planet's finite resources, developing its energy 
supplies, feeding its billions, protecting its environment, and shackling 
its weapons are some of these problems. If the zest, drive, and 
dedication that made Apollo a success can be brought to bear, that may 
be the most priceless legacy of Apollo.
