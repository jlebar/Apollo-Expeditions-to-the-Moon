Our first look at Earth rise over the eastern rim of the Moon was radioed
back by Lunar Orbiter I on August 23,1966. At the moment this picture was shot,
the spacecraft was flying 730 miles above the lunar far side. The photo gave 
man a disarming view of his own world. But the sweep of tortured lunar surface
revealed in the Orbiter pictures was a dramatic preview of the unearthly realm
that the Apollo astronauts would soon see.

After centuries of studying the Moon and its motions, most astronomers faced
with diminishing returns - had abandoned it to lovers and poets by the time that
Sputnik ushered in the space age. The hardy few who had not been wooed away to
greener astronomical pastures were soon to be richly rewarded for their patience.

<br><br>
Before the invention of the telescope in 1608, astronomers had to be content with
two good eyes and a fertile imagination to surmise the nature of the lunar surface. 
As a consequence they mainly devoted themselves to the mathematics of the Moon's
motions relative to the Earth and Sun. The early telescopes that first revealed the
crater-pocked face of the Moon touched off several centuries of speculation about the
lunar surface by scientists and fiction writers alike - it often being unclear who was
writing the fiction. But telescopes peering through the turbulent atmosphere of Earth
have severe limitations. By 1956 the very best terrestrial telescope images of the Moon
were only able to resolve objects about the size of the U.S. Capitol. Anything smaller
was a mystery.

Galileo drew the Moon in 1610 and described its
surface as "uneven, rough, replete with cavities and
packed with protruding eminences." While a correct description, 
his details are unrecognizable now.

Harold Urey enhanced our view of the lunar surface 
by creating this montage made from segments
of Lick Observatory photos taken when the Sun
angle was low so that shadows emphasized relief.

So the question remained: What was the lunar surface really like? While few
people really believed the Moon to be made of green cheese, many scientific hypotheses
cherished not long ago were equally strange and rather more ominous. They included
deep fields of dust into which a spacecraft might sink; a labyrinth of "fairy castles" such
as children build by dripping wet sand at the beach; electrostatic dust that might spring
up and engulf an alien object; and treacherously covered crevasses into which an unwary 
astronaut might fall. What proved to be the most accurate prediction, however,
likened the Moon to a World War I battlefield, bombarded by a rain of meteoroids
throughout the millennia, and churned into a wasteland of craters and debris. The
absence of an atmosphere and the low gravitational field would allow small secondary
particles to be blasted from the surface by a primary meteoroid impact and thrown
unimpeded halfway around the Moon. This led to the concept of a uniform blanket of
ejecta over the entire Moon.

A Juno II launch vehicle was made up
of an Army Ballistic Missile Agency's
modified Jupiter first stage with a
spin-stabilized solid-rocket upper
stage developed by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. JPL also developed the
13.4-lb Pioneer IV payload (right). 
Launched March 3, 1959, it
helped detect and measure the second
of the Earth's great radiation belts.

The Thor-Able, with more advanced upper
stages, propelled the 94.4-lb Pioneer V spacecraft 
to escape velocity on March 11, 1960.
The instrumentation of this payload (right)
measured the Earth's outer magnetosphere,
detected an interplanetary magnetic field,
helped explain the effect of solar flares on
cosmic rays, and first detected the plasma
clouds emitted by the Sun during solar storms.
But it told nothing new about the Moon.

An unsuccessful effort to orbit the
Moon was made with the Atlas-Able
launch vehicle (left) and the
P-31 spacecraft (right). The launch
vehicle was capable of injecting 380
lb into a translunar trajectory. The
39-in. spacecraft carried two 18.5-lb-thrust 
liquid-propellant engines for
flight-path corrections and injection
into lunar orbit.

But our story is getting ahead of itself. The surface properties of the Moon were
largely unknown in 1958, a matter which assumed great practical importance when
man's first journeys to the Moon began to take shape. How much weight would the
surface support? What were the slopes? Were there many rocks - and of what size?
Would the dust or dirt cling? What was the intensity of primary and secondary meteoroid 
bombardment? What was the exact size and shape of the Moon, and what were
the details of the lunar gravity field into which our spaceships would one day plunge?
