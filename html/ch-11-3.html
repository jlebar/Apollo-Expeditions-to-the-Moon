 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>

<h3>ASLEEP IN LUNAR ORBIT</h3>

We began preparing the LM. It was scheduled to take three
hours, but because I had already started the checkout, we were
completed a half hour ahead of schedule. Reluctantly we returned
to the Columbia as planned. Our fourth night we were to sleep in
lunar orbit. Although it was not in the flight plan, before
covering the windows and dousing the lights, Neil and I carefully
prepared all the equipment and clothing we would need in the
morning, and mentally ran through the many procedures we would
follow.
<br><br>
COLLINS: "Apollo 11, Apollo 11, good morning from the Black
Team." Could they be talking to me? It takes me twenty seconds to
fumble for the microphone button and answer groggily, I guess I
have only been asleep five hours or so; I had a tough time
getting to sleep, and now I'm having trouble waking up. Neil,
Buzz, and I all putter about fixing breakfast and getting various
items ready for transfer into the LM. [Later] I stuff Neil and
Buzz into the LM along with an armload of equipment. Now I have
to do the tunnel bit again, closing hatches, installing drogue
and probe, and disconnecting the electrical umbilical. I am on
the radio constantly now, running through an elaborate series of
joint checks with Eagle. I check progress with Buzz: "I have five
minutes and fifteen seconds since we started. Attitude is holding
very well." "Roger, Mike, just hold it a little bit longer." "No
sweat, I can hold it all day. Take your sweet time. How's the
czar over there? He's so quiet." Neil chimes in, "Just hanging
on- and punching." Punching those computer buttons, I guess he
means. "All I can say is, beware the revolution," and then,
getting no answer, I formally bid them goodbye. "You cats take it
easy on the lunar surface...." "O.K., Mike," Buzz answers
cheerily, and I throw the switch which releases them. With my
nose against the window and the movie camera churning away, I
watch them go. When they are safely clear of me, I inform Neil,
and he begins a slow pirouette in place, allowing me a look at
his outlandish machine and its four extended legs. "The Eagle has
wings'" Neil exults.
<br><br>
It doesn't look like any eagle I have ever seen. It is the
weirdest-looking contraption ever to invade the sky, floating
there with its legs awkwardly jutting out above a body which has
neither symmetry nor grace. I make sure all four landing gears
arc down and locked, report that fact, and then lie a little, "I
think you've got a fine-looking flying machine there. Eagle,
despite the fact you're upside down." "Somebody's upside down,"
Neil retorts. "O.K., Eagle. One minute . . . you guys take care."
Neil answers, "See you later." I hope so. When the one minute is
up, I fire my thrusters precisely as planned and we begin to
separate, checking distances and velocities as we go. This burn
is a very small one, just to give Eagle some breathing room. From
now on it's up to them, and they will make two separate burns in
reaching the lunar surface. The first one will serve to drop
Eagle's perilune to fifty thousand feet. Then, when they reach
this spot over the eastern edge of the Sea of Tranquility,
Eagle's descent engine will be fired up for the second and last
time, and Eagle will lazily are over into a 12-minute computer-
controlled descent to some point at which Neil will take over for
a manual landing.
<br><br>
ALDRIN: We were still 60 miles above the surface when we
began our first burn. Neil and I were harnessed into the LM in a
standing position. [Later] at precisely the right moment the
engine ignited to begin the 12-minute powered descent. Strapped
in by the system of belts and cables not unlike shock absorbers,
neither of us felt the initial motion. We looked quickly at the
computer to make sure we were actually functioning as planned.
After 26 seconds the engine went to full throttle and the motion
became noticeable. Neil watched his instruments while I looked at
our primary computer and compared it with our second computer,
which was part of our abort guidance system.
<br><br>
I then began a computer read-out sequence to Neil which was
also being transmitted to Houston. I had helped develop it. It
sounded as though I was chattering like a magpie. It also sounded
as though I was doing all the work. During training we had
discussed the possibility of making the communication only
between Neil and myself, but Mission Control liked the idea of
hearing our communications with each other. Neil had referred to
it once as "that damned open mike of yours," and I tried to make
as little an issue of it as possible.

Its legs folded up for launch, the lunar module
looked like this as the command module eased
in to dock and draw it free from the third stage
of the Saturn launch vehicle.

An offset docking target on the LM lined up
with the pilot's window on the CSM if align-
ment was right. Then an array of powerful
latches locked the two spacecraft together.
