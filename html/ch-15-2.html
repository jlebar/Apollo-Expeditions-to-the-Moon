<h3>IMPLANTING SENSORS ON THE MOON</h3>

Serious space probe studies of the Moon began with the
Soviet Zond and Luna, and with the U.S. Ranger, Surveyor, and
Lunar Orbiter. Armed with the information obtained by unmanned
probes, the United States carried out the Apollo manned missions,
implanting nuclear-powered geophysical laboratories at several
landing sites, including seismometers, magnetometers, plasma and
pressure gauges, heat flow instruments, and laser corner
reflectors. These laboratories continue to operate long after the
astronauts have returned to Earth. On two missions, the lunar
surface laboratories were supplemented by satellites left in
orbit to support geodetic studies. Detailed studies of lunar
surface composition by X-ray fluorescence and radioactivity
measurements were made from the Apollo spacecraft itself. Most
importantly. the astronauts brought back from their six landing
missions hundreds of pounds of lunar rocks and soil, which,
together with the small amount returned by Soviet unmanned sample
missions, have since been the subject of analysis and study by
scientists around the world.
<br><br>
How old is the Moon? This was the first major question.
Although a few thought the Moon would prove to be considerably
younger than Earth. most felt it would turn out to be of the same
vintage as our own planet. From radioactive dating of the lunar
rocks and soil it is now established that the Moon formed about
4.6 billion years ago. The Moon is, indeed, very old, as old as
Earth, and is telling us much about the earliest years of our
planet and of the solar system. But to our great surprise the
lunar rocks show that the Moon's surface is no longer in its
original condition, having undergone considerable change in the
first 1.5 billion years. A few of the highland rocks in the
Apollo samples are older than 4 billion years - at least one is
4.6 billion years old, the probable time of formation and initial
melting of the Moon - but most of them have been shocked and
remelted by meteoroid impacts 4 billion years ago. Most of the
mare lava flows are from 3 to slightly less than 4 billion years
old. indicating that substantial melting and flow occurred on the
Moon long after its formation. Gravitational energy released
during the aggregation of the Moon, heat generated by radioactive
elements in the lunar material, and thermal effects of the huge
impacts that sculptured the lunar surface all undoubtedly
contributed to the early melting of the outer layers.
<br><br>
What is the physical condition of the lunar surface? The
question generated countless heated debates before the lunar
landings. It was clear from the visible meteorite cratering that
the surface must be thoroughly chopped up. How fine would the
material be? Would it be loosely or densely packed? Could it hold
a spacecraft landed upon it? How thick would the layer of rubble
be? Some spoke of deep deposits of finely powdered dust into
which a spacecraft would sink out of sight. Now we know that the
Moon's surface is everywhere covered with many feet of fragmented
material, or regolith. A sizable fraction of the soil is very
fine dust, but the material is sufficiently cohesive and well
packed that it easily supported the Apollo spacecraft, the
astronauts, and their lunar rover.
<br><br>
Of what is the Moon made? This was a question about which
one could only speculate from afar. It could be essentially
meteoritic material. It might be like the Earth's crust. Or it
might be something entirely different. Any proposition put forth,
however, had to satisfy the constraint that the Moon's density is
only 3.36 , considerably lighter than Earth's average density of
5.5. One of the major questions was: Is there any water there?
Water would be the most important constituent that one might hope
to find on the Moon. It would be essential for the support of any
microbial life there. It would be an invaluable resource for
lunar bases that might be established in the remote future. No
one expected to find water exposed on the surface - it would
quickly evaporate in the airless, oven-hot environment of the
lunar day - but many supposed that there might be substantial
subsurface water in the form of ice as a permafrost. Even if free
water were not found, it was fully expected that there would be
water of crystallization in the lunar minerals.
<br><br>
Learning at firsthand about the stuff of which the Moon is
made from the actual lunar material carried back by the Apollo
astronauts has been one of the most exciting scientific
undertakings of our day. More than 700 scientists, including
several hundred from twenty other countries, have spent uncounted
hours analyzing samples, conducting laboratory tests, and
theorizing over the significance of what was being revealed for
the first time. Annually at the Johnson Space Center they have
assembled to share their findings and to try to explain them. No
water was found. Lunar material is very dry. with practically no
water of crystallization. The hydrous minerals so common on Earth
arc exceedingly rare in the lunar rocks and soil. Moreover, lunar
material is depleted in most volatile elements. suggesting a very
hot processing at some time in their history. The rocks in the
lunar maria arc similar to, though significantly different from,
lavas on Earth. Highland samples show a considerable separation
of lunar material into different minerals, showing a
differentiation like that responsible for the wide variety of
rocks and minerals on Earth. Moon material is neither exactly
like the meteorites nor exactly like the Earth's crust, but all
three could have had a common source with a different history.
