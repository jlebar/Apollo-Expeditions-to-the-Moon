<br><br>
At last everything was coming together - all those elements that had been
committed piecemeal - the command module in Apollo 7, the first manned flight away
from the bonds of Earth in Apollo 8, the flying of the lunar module with men on
board in Apollo 9, and then Apollo 10, which went to the Moon and did everything
short of landing. It all led up to that hot July morning in 1969, when Apollo's moment
of truth was irreversibly upon us.
<br><br>
Uncounted things had to be done before we reached that moment. Before the
operational phase even began, we had to pass through the conceptualization and 
construction phase, remembering something Jim Webb once said, "The road to the Moon
will be paved by bricks and steel and concrete here on Earth." For Apollo we had to
build Complex 39 at a cost of half a billion dollars, that is, we had to finish Stage
Zero, before we could proceed to Stage One, the flying of the birds.
<br><br>
Complex 39 was to Moon exploration what Palos was to Columbus: the takeoff
point. Man had never attempted any such thing before, and I wonder when he will
again. Everything was outsize - among the impressive statistics about the core of
Complex 39, the Vehicle Assembly Building, were its capacity (nearly twice as big
as the Pentagon) and its height (525 feet, thirty feet short of the Washington Monument's).
<br><br>
During 39's construction phase we were, of course, flying Saturn Is - ten of them - and 
in 1966 three Saturn IBs, all from Pads 34 and 37. Everything - launches and
construction - had to mesh; it was like building a thousand different homes for a
thousand demanding people. It was on the last of these IBs that I made my rookie
appearance as director of launch operations, August 25, 1966. The mission was a
1 hour 23 minute suborbital flight to test the command and service module subsystems
and the heatshield. CM 011 was recovered near Wake Island in good condition; its
shield had withstood the heat of reentry at 19,900 mph.
<br><br>
During the construction phase of Complex 39 (1961-66) I was Apollo Program
Manager at the Cape. The first thing we had to do was decide where to build the
moonport. My boss, Dr. Kurt Debus, and Maj. Gen. Leighton Davis, USAF, were
directed to find a place from which to launch huge vehicles like the projected Nova
or the Saturn V - Cape Canaveral's 17,000 acres weren't nearly large enough. In this
study we considered sites in Hawaii, the California coast, Cumberland Island off
Georgia, Mayaguana Island in the Bahamas, Padre Island off the coast of Texas, and
several others. Eventually we concluded that the most advantageous site was Merritt
Island, right next to the Air Force's Cape Canaveral facilities, which had been launching 
missiles since 1950 and NASA vehicles since 1958. Our report was completed
July 31, 1961, and we spent all night printing it, after which Dr. Debus and I flew up
to Washington and briefed Mr. Webb and Dr. Seamans. So 84,000 acres of sand and
scrub were acquired for NASA by the government, plus 56,000 additional acres of
submerged lands, at a total cost of $71,872,000.
<br><br>
We lost no time in raising the curtain on Stage Zero. No one who was involved
can ever forget the driving urgency that attended Apollo. Nor the dedication of those
who worked on it, including the construction crews, who by 1965 numbered 7000
persons at the Cape.

A launch pad looked different in the early
days at the Cape. Here Redstone 4 is in
final stages of preparation in August 1954.
The plume of vapor at the base is oxygen
boiling off, a hazard being ignored by
the men at work; but the presence of an
ambulance suggests awareness that all
might not necessarily go well. Central sections 
of the deployment track are concreted, 
to keep exhaust gases from tearing
up the pad. This launch was successful.

At one time we had considered preparing the space vehicle horizontally, and
then erecting it vertically on the pad, but this was simply out of the question for a
360-foot bird. So we had to erect the Saturn V stage by stage, which meant that,
because of rain and wind, we had to have an enclosed building. Even a 10- to 15-knot
wind would have given us trouble while we were erecting outdoors, and higher winds
could prove disastrous. Thus the Vehicle Assembly Building became an enclosed
structure. Should the high bays be strung out four in a row, or built back-to-back?
We decided on the latter format because only two big cranes (250-ton bridge cranes)
would be needed instead of four, and because the box-like structure would better
withstand hurricane winds of 125 mph. The possibility of hurricanes also dictated
that we have two crawlers, one to carry the Mobile Service Structure away from the
pad, and one to bring the Apollo-Saturn V and its Mobile Launcher to shelter in the
VAB. The height of the building was dictated by the hook height, and we started
planning for 465 feet; the final height was 525. Remember that when we started
planning the VAB in 1961 we weren't sure what size bird would roost in this big nest.
We also had to begin design work before we knew whether the trip to the Moon would
involve an Earth-orbit or lunar-orbit rendezvous.
<br><br>
I think of the VAB not as a building but as an intricate machine that assembled
the vehicle in its final phases. People were surprised to learn that the various stages had
never seen each other until they were introduced in the VAB drydock. The first stage
had been built by Boeing at Michoud outside New Orleans, the second stage by North
American at Redondo Beach, Calif., the third by McDonnell Douglas at Huntington
Beach, Calif., and the Instrument Unit by IBM at Huntsville, Ala. The spacecraft that
went on top of this stack were also introduced for the first time in the VAB, the
CSM from the North American plant at Downey, Calif., and the LM from Grumman
in Bethpage, Long Island.
<br><br>
Could these pieces, arriving from all over the country, play together? Every wire
in every plug had to join exactly the right wire, with no electrical interference or
change of signal strength, and a command signal had to work from the Instrument
Unit through the third and second stages into the first. After the various stages had
been put together they had to be checked out as an entity, and once this had been
done you naturally don't want to break the electrical connections again. When the
Instrument Unit orders "Go right", you don't want an engine three stages down to
go left. The pieces not only had to match each other, but also the ground equipment.
Lines for the flow of liquid hydrogen from the ground had to match the stages, and so
did others for the flow of liquid oxygen and still others for gaseous nitrogen and
helium. Television monitors had to be designed and installed so that we could know
what was happening in hundreds of places at any given time - which meant all the
time.

The skill required of the technicians working within Complex 39 - and throughout
the Kennedy Space Center - had to be fine-honed. One of the legends had it that the
crane operator who set the 88,000-pound second stage on top of the first stage had to
qualify for the job by lowering a similar weight until it touched a raw egg without
cracking the shell. Of the Cape's 26,500 workers - the peak number in 1968 - a high
percentage were men and women who possessed such skills. One can speculate whether
such a crew is likely to be assembled in one place again.
<br><br>
The pads of Complex 39 were abuilding at the same time the VAB rose on its
4225 16-inch steel pipe pilings that had been driven more than 160 feet below the
sandy surface into bedrock. Pad A and Pad B were twins, each occupying about 160
acres; we had also planned a Pad C, which explains why the crawlerway from A to B
has an elbow-like crook in it - the elbow would have led to C. 
(We even had a contingency 
plan for a Pad D in case launchings became more and more frequent.) The
pads were built 8700 feet apart so that an explosion could not wreck more than
one of them. They were located three and one-half miles from the VAB and the
Launch Control Center. In the early days we'd had to control a launch from a site
close to the pad, to avoid electrical problems induced by a longer run of electric
cabling, which in turn meant that we worked from a blockhouse heavily protected
against fire and blast. Now, by the time the Saturns were ready, digital data technology
had advanced to the point where firing rooms could be in a structure miles away.
<br><br>
How to get the Apollo-Saturn V from its birthplace in the VAB to the pad from
which it would fly for the first and only time in its life? Early in the program we
considered moving it on its three and one-half mile journey by water. The barge concept 
was deep in our thinking: the first and second stages had to come to the Cape
from Louisiana and California, respectively, by man's oldest form of transportation,
since they were too large to go through tunnels or under bridges. On this short trip
why not also float the Saturn V and its Mobile Launcher standing upright on a barge?
We got the Navy to run tests at the David Taylor Model Basin in Washington, which
showed that the hydrodynamic requirements of such a topheavy barge would be too
demanding. We looked into a rail system, into pneumatic-tire transporters, and ground
effects machines but all were impractical or too expensive.

Then somebody in our shop came up with the idea of using giant tracked
machines like those used in strip mining. What evolved was the unique crawler or,
more politely, transporter. As built by the Marion Power Shovel Company, the crawler
took shape with eight tracks, each 7 by 41 feet, with cleats like a Sherman tank, except
that each cleat weighed a ton. Mounted over these eight tracks was the platform, bigger
than a baseball diamond, on which the Apollo-Saturn V and its Mobile Launcher
would ride majestically from VAB to pad at one mile per hour. The package weighed
9000 tons, two-thirds cargo, one-third crawler.
<br><br>
If that sounds easy, it wasn't. In July 1965, during a test, some bearings cracked
because we had assumed the weight would be equally distributed on various parts of
the crawler. We were wrong. The bearings, incidentally, were ten inches in diameter
and there were eleven sets of them. This problem was met by changing from roller
bearings to sleeve bearings; we also topped off the crawlerway with eight inches of
Alabama river rock to distribute the load evenly and to relieve friction at the turns.
