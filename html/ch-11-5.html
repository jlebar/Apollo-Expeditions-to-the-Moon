<h3>THE BOY IN THE CANDY STORE</h3>

ARMSTRONG: There were a lot of things to do, and we had a
hard time getting, them finished. We had very little trouble,
much less trouble than expected, on the surface. It was a
pleasant operation. Temperatures weren't high. They were very
comfortable. The little EMU, the combination of spacesuit and
backpack that sustained our life on the surface, operated
magnificently. The primary difficulty was just far too little
time to do the variety of things we would have liked. We had the
problem of the five-year-old boy in a candy store.
<br><br>
ALDRIN: I took off jogging to test my maneuverability. The
exercise gave me an odd sensation and looked even more odd when I
later saw the films of it. With bulky suits on, we seemed to be
moving in slow motion. I noticed immediately that my inertia
seemed much greater. Earth-bound, I would have stopped my run in
just one step, but I had to use three of four steps to sort of
wind down. My Earth weight, with the big backpack and heavy suit,
was 360 pounds. On the Moon I weighed only 60 pounds.
<br><br>
At one point I remarked that the surface was "Beautiful,
beautiful. Magnificent desolation." I was struck by the contrast
between the starkness of the shadows and the desert-like
barrenness of the rest of the surface. It ranged from dusty gray
to light tan and was unchanging except for one startling sight:
our LM sitting there with its black, silver, and bright yellow-
orange thermal coating shining brightly in the otherwise
colorless landscape. I had seen Neil in his suit thousands of
times before, but on the Moon the unnatural whiteness of it
seemed unusually brilliant. We could also look around and see the
Earth, which, though much larger than the Moon the Earth was
seeing, seemed small - a beckoning oasis shining far away in the
sky.
<br><br>
As the sequence of lunar operations evolved, Neil had the
camera most of the time, and the majority of pictures taken on
the Moon that include an astronaut are of me. It wasn't until we
were back on Earth and in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory looking
over the pictures that we realized there were few pictures of
Neil. My fault perhaps, but we had never simulated this in our
training.
