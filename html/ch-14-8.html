<h3>TOURING THE MOON</h3>

Encumbered by a spacesuit, an astronaut on foot could 
not venture very far from the LM; carrying tools and 
samples made his forays more difficult.  On the last 
three lunar missions a lightweight electric car greatly increased 
the productivity of the scientific traverses.  Mission 
rules restricted us from going more than 6 miles from the 
LM - the distance we could walk back in a pinch - but even 
so the area that could be investigated was ten times 
greater than before.  The Rover's mobility was quite high; 
it could climb and descend slopes above 25°.  Crossing a 
steep slope was uneasy for the man on the downhill side, 
but there were no rollovers. On the level we averaged 
close to our top speed of 7 mph.  Once, going down the 
Lee-Lincoln scarp, we set an informal lunar speed record 
for four-wheeled vehicles of 11 mph.

Folded up to fit within its storage bay in the LM descent stage,
the little car was designed so that it almost assembled itself.

Deploying the Lunar Rover<br>
Carried to the Moon in a nose-down, floorpan-out position, 
the Rover could be deployed by an Astronaut paying 
out two nylon tapes. In the first stage the car swings 
out from its storage bay. Then the rear part of the chassis 
unfolds and locks, and the rear wheels unfold. In the third 
stage the front chassis and wheels snap out.
Finally, the astronaut lowers it to the surface, and 
unfolds the seats and footrests. Torsion-bar springs and latches 
mode assembly semiautomatic. Power for the Rover came 
from two 36-volt silver-zinc batteries driving an 
independent 1/4-hp motor in each wheel. A navigation 
system kept track of the bearing and range to the LM.

Parked by Hadley Rille in the first of the traverses 
shown at left above, the Apollo 15 Rover had already displayed 
its workhorse willingness. It weighed 462 pounds (but 
only 77 on the Moon), and could carry two suited astronauts, 
their gear and cameras, and several hundred pounds of bagged samples.
