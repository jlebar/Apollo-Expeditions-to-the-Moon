<h3>COAXING THE FLAG TO STAND</h3>

During a pause in experiments, Neil suggested we proceed
with the flag. It took both of us to set it up and it was nearly
a disaster. Public Relations obviously needs practice just as
everything else does. A small telescoping arm was attached to the
flagpole to keep the flag extended and perpendicular. As hard as
we tried, the telescope wouldn't fully extend. Thus the flags
which should have been flat, had its own unique permanent wave.
Then to our dismay the staff of the pole wouldn't go far enough
into the lunar surface to support itself in an upright position.
After much struggling we finally coaxed it to remain upright, but
in a most precarious position. I dreaded the possibility of the
American flag collapsing into the lunar dust in front of the
television camera.
<br><br>
COLLINS: [On his fourth orbital pass above] "How's it
going?" "The EVA is progressing beautifully. I believe they're
setting up the flag now." Just let things keep going that way,
and no surprises, please. Neil and Buzz sound good, with no
huffing and puffing to indicate they are overexerting themselves.
But one surprise at least is in store. Houston comes on the air,
not the slightest bit ruffled, and announces that the President
of the United States would like to talk to Neil and Buzz. "That
would be an honor," says Neil, with characteristic dignity.
<br><br>
The President's voice smoothly fills the air waves with the
unaccustomed cadence of the speechmaker, trained to convey
inspiration, or at least emotion, instead of our usual diet of
numbers and reminders. "Neil and Buzz, I am talking to you by
telephone from the Oval Office at the White House, and this
certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever
made . . . Because of what you have done, the heavens have become
a part of man's world. As you talk to us from the Sea of
Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring
peace and tranquility to Earth . . ." My God, I never thought of
all this bringing peace and tranquility to anyone. As far as I am
concerned, this voyage is fraught with hazards for the three of
us- and especially two of us- and that is about as far as I have
gotten in my thinking.
<br><br>
Neil, however, pauses long enough to give as well as he
receives. "It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here,
representing not only the United States but men of peace of all
nations, and with interest and a curiosity and a vision for the
future."

Scientific experiments, stowed compactly for their trip to the
Moon, are unpacked for deployment by Aldrin. Note the spread-leg 
stability of the landed LM, its sturdy legs foil-wrapped for
thermal insulation. Beyond the right leg can be seen the solar-wind 
experiment, an exposed foil sheet that will be brought back
to Earth for careful analysis; and beyond it the television camera.

Aldrin drops off the retroreflector for laser ranging of
the Earth-Moon distance, and takes the seismometer experiment
15 feet farther out. The former gave new accuracy to measurement 
of the Moon's orbit. The seismometer was the first of an
array of seismic stations now emplaced on the Moon.

[Later] Houston cuts off the White House and returns to
business as usual, with a long string of numbers for me to copy
for future use. My God, the juxtaposition of the incongruous:
roll, pitch, and yaw; prayers, peace, and tranquility. What will
it be like if we really carry this off and return to Earth in one
piece, with our boxes full of rocks and our heads full of new
perspectives for the planet? I have a little time to ponder this
as I zing off out of sight of the White House and the Earth.
<br><br>
ALDRIN: We had a pulley system to load on the boxes of
rocks. We found the process more time-consuming and dust-scattering 
than anticipated. After the gear and both of us were
inside, our first chore was to pressure the LM cabin and begin
stowing the rock boxes, film magazines, and anything else we
wouldn't need until we were connected once again with the
Columbia. We removed our boots and the big backpacks, opened the
LM hatch, and threw these items onto the lunar surface, along
with a bagful of empty food packages and the LM urine bags. The
exact moment we tossed every thing out was measured back on
Earth- the seismometer we had put out was even more sensitive
than we had expected.

Ghosting up to its crucial rendezvous with Columbia, 
its legs and landing stage left behind on
the surface as a launching platform, Eagle's historic 
voyage is almost done. Once its film, rock
boxes, and two exhilarated astronauts have come 
aboard, Eagle will be left in lunar orbit while
the three men set out for the distant half-planet 
shown here that is man's home.

Before beginning liftoff procedures [we] settled down for
our fitful rest. We didn't sleep much at all. Among other things
we were elated- and also cold. Liftoff from the Moon, after a
stay totaling twenty-one hours, was exactly on schedule and
fairly uneventful. The ascent stage of the LM separated, sending
out a shower of brilliant insulation particles which had been
ripped off from the thrust of the ascent engine. There was no
lime to sightsee. I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil
was studying the attitude indicator, but I looked up long enough
to see the flag fall over . . . Three hours and ten minutes later
we were connected once again with the Columbia.
<br><br>
COLLINS: I can look out through my docking reticle and see
that they are steady as a rock as they drive down the center line
of that final approach path. I give them some numbers. "I have
0.7 mile and I got you at 31 feet per second." We really are
going to carry this off' For the first time since I was assigned
to this incredible flight, I feel that it is going to happen.
Granted, we are a long way from home, but from here on it should
be all downhill. Within a few seconds Houston joins the
conversation, with a tentative little call. "Eagle and Columbia,
Houston standing by." They want to know what the hell is going
on, but they don't want to interrupt us if we are in a crucial
spot in our final maneuvering. Good heads! However, they needn't
worry, and Neil lets them know it. "Roger, we're stationkeeping."
