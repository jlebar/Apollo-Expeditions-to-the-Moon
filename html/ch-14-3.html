<h3>INCONCEIVABLE VIOLENCE</h3>

The cratered highland phase that followed was extremely,
almost inconceivably violent. The debris left over from the
creation of the planets bombarded the light-colored crust. These
highland surfaces have survived as the bright portions of the
full Moon we see today. They were pulverized, remelted,
reaggregated, and, finally, saturated with craters at least 30 to
60 miles in diameter. The sheer violence of those times is
difficult to comprehend.
<br><br>
The large basin phase was the time when very large basins
were formed. This appears to have been the result of a distinctly
more massive scale of bombardment than that which preceded their
formation. These large basins dominate the surface character of
the front side of the Moon and are responsible for the major
chemical differences we have measured between various large
surface regions.

Mounting the Rover when spacesuited takes a bit of doing.
You stand facing forward by the side of the vehicle, jump upward
about two feet with a simultaneous sideways push, kick your feet
out ahaed, and wait as you slowly settle into the seat, ideally in 
the correct one. Here I'm completimg the job.

The light-colored plains phase that followed was a brief,
still controversial period in which most old basins appear to
have been partially filled with debris largely derived from the
surrounding light-colored crust. The events that created these
plains are poorly understood partly because several different
processes related to both meteor impact and internal volcanism
may have produced similar plains.
<br><br>
The basaltic maria phase was the main period during which
the accumulation of heat from radioactive elements within the
Moon produced melting and volcanic eruptions. Those eruptions
filled all of the large basins with thick masses of dark-colored
basalt called the maria. (These sea-like regions are the dark
portions of the full Moon.) The lunar basalts are very different
from basalts on Earth; they contain much less sodium, carbon, and
water and commonly have much more titanium. iron, and heavy
elements. At least the upper parts of the maria are ancient lava
flows up to 300 feet thick. Many flows differ significantly from
each other in chemical and mineral characteristics, differences
that vary with both the age and the region.

The television camera on the Rover, which could be
remotely controlled from Earth during traverse stops,
was the eye of the science team. It gave them much of the
information needed to radio advice up to us.

Broken fenders slung lunar dust about wickedly,
but could be repaired by a field fix consisting of spare
maps held by clamps. By chance the commanders of the
last three missions each somehow managed to break 
a fragile fender.

The quiet crust phase from about 3.0 billion years ago to
the present was largely just that- quiet. Compared to the past,
very little happened except for the formation of scattered, very
bright craters like Tycho and Copernicus, the creation of
regional fault systems like the Hyginus Rille, and the appearance
of mysterious light-colored swirls like Reiner Gamma. Eruptions
of basaltic maria also seem to have continued along a ridge and
volcanic system that stretches for 1200 miles along the north-
south axis of Mare Procellarum. Some of the events may be
indications of continuing internal activity and stress beneath a
now strong crust, such as the slow, solid convection of the lunar
mantle.
<br><br>
For the most part, the surface of the Moon appears to have
completed recording its history about three billion years ago. It
has been largely unchanged except for the continued eroding rain
of small meteors and now by the first primitive probings of men.
<br><br>
The Moon is as chemically and structurally differentiated as
the Earth, lacking only the continued refinements of internal
melting, solid convection, surficial weathering, and recycling of
the crust. It moves through space as an ancient text, related to
the history of the Earth only through the interpretations of our
minds. It also exists as an archive of our Sun, possibly
preserving in its soils much information of importance to man's
future.
<br><br>
If we are to continue to read the text, we must continue to
go there and beyond.
