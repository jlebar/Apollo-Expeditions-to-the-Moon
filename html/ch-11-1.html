The loneliness of space exploration is captured in this picture of Buzz Aldrin standing by Eagle's
foil-wrapped footpad. (But a tiny image of Armstrong taking the photograph can be seen on his
reflective faceplate.) The slightly arms-out stance derives from the pressurized suit. A plaque on
the landing stage, which is still on the Moon, is engraved: "Here men from the planet Earth
first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969, A.D. We came in peace for all mankind."

<b>Prelude
<br><br>
All was ready. Everything had been done. Projects Mercury
and Gemini. Seven years of Project Apollo. The work of more than
300,000 Americans. Six previous unmanned and manned Apollo
flights. Planning, testing, analyzing, training. The time had
come.
<br><br>
We had a great deal of confidence. We had confidence in our
hardware: the Saturn rocket, the command module, and the lunar
module. All flight segments had been flown on the earlier Apollo
fights with the exception of the descent to and the accent from
the Moon's surface and, of course, the exploration work on the
surface. These portions were far from trivial, however, and we
had concentrated our training on them. Months of simulation with
our colleagues in the Mission Control Center had convinced us
that they were ready.
<br><br>
Although confident, we were certainly not overconfident. In
research and in exploration, the unexpected is always expected.
We were not overly concerned with our safety, but we would not be
surprised if a malfunction or an unforeseen occurrence prevented
a successful lunar landing.
<br><br>
As we ascended in the elevator to the top of the Saturn on
the morning of July 16, 1969, we knew that hundreds of thousands
of Americans had given their best effort to give us this chance.
Now it was time for us to give our best.

The splashdown May 26, 1969, of Apollo 10 cleared the way
for the first formal attempt at a manned lunar landing. Six days
before, the Apollo 11 launch vehicle and spacecraft half crawled
from the VAB and trundled at 0.9 mph to Pad 39-A. A successful
countdown test ending on July 3 showed the readiness of machines,
systems, and people. The next launch window (established by
lighting conditions at the landing site on Mare Tranquillitatis)
opened at 9:32 AM EDT on July 16, 1969. The crew for Apollo 11,
all of whom had already flown in space during Gemini, had been
intensively training as a team for many months. The following
mission account makes use of crew members' own words, from books
written by two of them, supplemented by space-to-ground and
press-conference transcripts.
</i>
<br><br>
ALDRIN: At breakfast early on the morning of the launch. Dr.
Thomas Paine, the Administrator of NASA, told us that concern for
our own safety must govern all our actions, and if anything
looked wrong we were to abort the mission. He then made a most
surprising and unprecedented statement: if we were forced to
abort, we would be immediately recycled and assigned to the next
landing attempt. What he said and how he said it was very
reassuring.
<br><br>
We were up early, ate, and began to suit up - a rather
laborious and detailed procedure involving many people, which we
would repeat once again, alone, before entering the LM for our
lunar landing.
<br><br>
While Mike and Neil were going through the complicated
business of being strapped in and connected to the spacecraft's
life-support system, I waited near the elevator on the floor
below. I waited alone for fifteen minutes in a sort of serene
limbo. As far as I could see there were people and cars lining
the beaches and highways. The surf was just beginning to rise out
of an azure-blue ocean. I could see the massiveness of the Saturn
V rocket below and the magnificent precision of Apollo above. I
savored the wait and marked the minutes in my mind as something I
would always want to remember.

Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., then an Air Force colonel, was the lunar
module pilot for Apollo 11 . He had graduated third in his class
at West Point, and earned a Ph.D. in astronautics at MIT. His
prior space experience was as pilot for Gemini 12.

COLLINS: I am everlastingly thankful that I have flown
before, and that this period of waiting atop a rocket is nothing
new. I am just as tense this time, but the tenseness comes mostly
from an appreciation of the enormity of our undertaking rather
than from the unfamiliarity of the situation. I am far from
certain that we will be able to fly the mission as planned. I
think we will escape with our skins, or at least I will escape
with mine, but I wouldn't give better than even odds on a
successful landing and return. There arc just too many things
that can go wrong. Fred Haise [the backup astronaut who had
checked command-module switch positions] has run through a
checklist 417 steps long. and I have merely a half dozen minor
chores to take care of - nickel and dime stuff. In between switch
throws I have plenty of time to think, if not daydream. Here I
am, a white male, age thirty-eight, height 5 feet 11 inches,
weight 165 pounds, salary $17,000 per annum, resident of a Texas
suburb, with black spot on my roses, state of mind unsettled,
about to be shot off to the Moon. Yes, to the Moon.
<br><br>
At the moment, the most important control is over on Neil's
side, just outboard of his left knee. It is the abort handle, and
now it has power to it, so if Neil rotates it 30
counterclockwise, three solid rockets above us will fire and yank
the CM free of the service module and everything below it. It is
only to be used in extremes. A large bulky pocket has been added
to Neil's left suit leg, and it looks as though if he moves his
leg slightly, it's going to snag on the abort handle. I quickly
point this out to Neil, and he grabs the pocket and pulls it as
far over to the inside of his thigh as he can, but it still doesn't
look secure to either one of us. Jesus, I can see the headlines now:
"MOONSHOT FALLS INTO OCEAN." Mistake by crew, program officials
intimate. Last transmission from Armstrong prior to leaving the
pad reportedly was 'Oops.'"

Michael Collins was the command module pilot,
in orbit above the two others on the surface. A
West Pointer and Air Force lieutenant colonel,
he had flown in Gemini 10. These unsmiling
photos were taken before the mission; but also
see <a href="ch-11-7.html#smile">here</a>.

ARMSTRONG: The flight started promptly, and I think that was
characteristic of all events of the flight. The Saturn gave us
one magnificent ride, both in Earth orbit and on a trajectory to
the Moon. Our memory of that differs little from the reports you
have heard from the previous Saturn V flights.
<br><br>
ALDRIN: For the thousands of people watching along the
beaches of Florida and the millions who watched on television,
our lift-off was ear shattering. For us there was a slight
increase in the amount of background noise, not at all unlike the
sort one notices taking off in a commercial airliner, and in less
than a minute we were traveling ahead of the speed of sound.
<br><br>
COLLINS: This beast is best felt. Shake, rattle, and roll!
We are thrown left and right against our straps in spasmodic
little jerks. It is steering like crazy, like a nervous lady
driving a wide car down a narrow alley, and I just hope it knows
where it's going, because for the first ten seconds we are
perilously close to that umbilical tower.
<br><br>

<img src="i11-2c.jpg" ALT="Neil Armstrong"> 
<td valign=bottom><font size=2>
Neil Armstrong, commander of Apollo 11, a
civilian, had flown in space in Gemini 8. An
engineer and test pilot, he once flew the X-15
above 200,000 feet and at more than 4000 mph.

<br>

ALDRIN: A busy eleven minutes later we were in Earth orbit.
The Earth didn't look much different from the way it had during
my first flight, and yet I kept looking at it. From space it has
an almost benign quality. Intellectually one could realize there
were wars underway, but emotionally it was impossible to
understand such things. The thought reoccurred that wars are
generally fought for territory or are disputes over borders; from
space the arbitrary borders established on Earth cannot be seen.
After one and a half orbits a preprogrammed sequence fired the
Saturn to send us out of Earth orbit and on our way to the Moon.
<br><br>
ARMSTRONG: Hey Houston, Apollo 11. This Saturn gave us a
magnificent ride. We have no complaints with any of the three
stages on that ride. It was beautiful.
<br><br>
COLLINS: We started the burn at 100 miles altitude, and had
reached only 180 at cutoff, but we are climbing like a dingbat.
In nine hours, when we are scheduled to make our first midcourse
correction, we will be 57,000 miles out. At the instant of
shutdown, Buzz recorded our velocity as 35,579 feet per second,
more than enough to escape from the Earth's gravitational field.
As we proceed outbound, this number will get smaller and smaller
until the tug of the Moon's gravity exceeds that of the Earth's
and then we will start speeding up again. It's hard to believe
that we are on our way to the Moon, at 1200 miles altitude now,
less than three hours after liftoff, and I'll bet the launch-day
crowd down at the Cape is still bumper to bumper, straggling back
to the motels and bars.
<br><br>
ALDRIN: Mike's next major task, with Neil and me assisting,
was to separate our command module Columbia from the Saturn third
stage, turn around and connect with the lunar module Eagle, which
was stored in the third stage. Eagle, by now, was exposed; its
four enclosing panels had automatically come off and were
drifting away. This of course was a critical maneuver in the
flight plan. If the separation and docking did not work, we would
return to Earth. There was also the possibility of an in-space
collision and the subsequent decompression of our cabin, so we
were still in our spacesuits as Mike separated us from the Saturn
third stage. Critical as the maneuver is, I felt no apprehension
about it, and if there was the slightest inkling of concern it
disappeared quickly as the entire separation and docking
proceeded perfectly to completion. The nose of Columbia was now
connected to the top of the Eagle and heading for the Moon as we
watched the Saturn third stage venting, a propulsive maneuver
causing it to move slowly away from us.
<br><br>
<i>
Fourteen hours after liftoff, at 10:30 PM by Houston time,
the three astronauts fasten covers over the windows of the slowly
rotating command module and go to sleep. Days 2 and 3 are devoted
to housekeeping chores, a small midcourse velocity correction,
and TV transmissions back to Earth. In one news digest from
Houston, the astronauts are amused to hear that Pravda has
referred to Armstrong as "the czar of the ship".
</i>
<br><br>
ALDRIN: In our preliminary flight plan I wasn't scheduled to
go to the LM until the next day in lunar orbit, but I had lobbied
successfully to go earlier. My strongest argument was that I'd
have ample time to make sure that the frail LM and its equipment
had suffered no damage during the launch and long trip. By that
time neither Neil nor I had been in the LM for about two weeks.
