 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
 <h3>CHAPTER 11.4</h3>

<h3>A YELLOW CAUTION LIGHT</h3>

At six thousand feet above the lunar surface a yellow
caution light came on and we encountered one of the few
potentially serious problems in the entire flight, a problem
which might have caused us to abort, had it not been for a man on
the ground who really knew his job.
<br><br>
COLLINS: At five minutes into the burn, when I am nearly
directly overhead, Eagle voices its first concern. "Program
Alarm," barks Neil, "It's a 1202." What the hell is that? I don't
have the alarm numbers memorized for my own computer, much less
for the LM's. I jerk out my own checklist and start thumbing
through it, but before I can find 1202, Houston says, "Roger,
we're GO on that alarm." No problem, in other words. My checklist
says 1202 is an "executive overflow," meaning simply that the
computer has been called upon to do too many things at once and
is forced to postpone some of them. A little farther along, at
just three thousand feet above the surface, the computer flashes
1201, another overflow condition, and again the ground is
superquick to respond with reassurances.

The unknown that is soon to be known: This picture 
shows the Apollo 11 landing site one orbit
before descent was begun. Tranquility 
Base is near the shadow line, a little to the right of
center. The big jagged shape to the 
left is not a shadow but an out-of-focus LM thruster.

ALDRIN: Back in Houston, not to mention on board the Eagle,
hearts shot up into throats while we waited to learn what would
happen. We had received two of the caution lights when Steve
Bales the flight controller responsible for LM computer activity,
told us to proceed, through Charlie Duke, the capsule
communicator. We received three or four more warnings but kept on
going. When Mike, Neil, and I were presented with Medals of
Freedom by President Nixon, Steve also received one. He certainly
deserved it, because without him we might not have landed.
<br><br>
ARMSTRONG: In the final phases of the descent after a number
of program alarms, we looked at the landing area and found a very
large crater. This is the area we decided we would not go into;
we extended the range downrange. The exhaust dust was kicked up
by the engine and this caused some concern in that it degraded
our ability to determine not only our altitude in the final
phases but also our translational velocities over the ground.
It's quite important not to stub your toe during the final phases
of touchdown.

"You cats take it easy," Collins radioed in 
farewell as the lunar module separated - for its
historic descent to the surface of the Moon. 
The three probes extending below the footpads
were to turn on a contact light reporting when 
the LM was within a few feet of the surface. On
the nearest landing leg note the ladder giving 
access to the surface from the cabin at the top.
The exhaust bell of the big descent engine can 
be seen in the center. It made two burns, finally
settling the LM gently on the surface with only 
seconds of fuel remaining.

HOUSTON: 30 seconds [fuel remaining].
<br><br>
EAGLE: Contact light! O.K., engine stop . . . descent engine

<br><br>
HOUSTON: We copy you down, Eagle.
<br><br>
EAGLE: Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed!
<br><br>
HOUSTON: Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground.
You've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing
again. Thanks a lot.
<br><br>
TRANQUILITY: Thank you . . . That may have seemed like a
very long final phase. The auto targeting was taking us right
into a football-field-sized crater, with a large number of big
boulders and rocks for about one or two crater-diameters around
it, and it required flying manually over the rock field to find a
reasonably good area.
<br><br>
HOUSTON: Roger, we copy. It was beautiful from here,
Tranquility. Over.
<br><br>
TRANQUILITY: We'll get to the details of what's around here,
but it looks like a collection of just about every variety of
shape, angularity, granularity, about every variety of rock you
could find.
<br><br>
HOUSTON: Roger, Tranquility. Be advised there's lots of
smiling faces in this room, and all over the world.
<br><br>
TRANQUILITY: There are two of them up here.
<br><br>
COLUMBIA: And don't forget one in the command module.
<br><br>
ARMSTRONG: Once [we] settled on the surface, the dust
settled immediately and we had an excellent view of the area
surrounding the LM. We saw a crater surface, pockmarked with
craters up to 15, 20, 30 feet, and many smaller craters down to a
diameter of 1 foot and, of course, the surface was very fine-
grained. There were a surprising number of rocks of all sizes.

Leaving the ninth step of the ladder, 
Aldrin jumps down to the
Moon. Earlier on the "porch" he
had radioed, "Now I want to partially 
close the hatch, making sure
not to lock it on my way out."
Armstrong's dry response was: "A
good thought." On Earth his
weight, including the spacesuit
and mechanism-filled portable life-support 
system, would have totaled 360 lb; 
but here the gross
came only to a bouncy 60 lb. The
descent-engine exhaust bell (extreme right) 
came to rest about a
foot above the surface.

A number of experts had, prior to the flight, predicted that
a good bit of difficulty might be encountered by people due to
the variety of strange atmospheric and gravitational
characteristics. This didn't prove to be the case and after
landing we felt very comfortable in the lunar gravity. It was, in
fact, in our view preferable both to weightlessness and to the
Earth's gravity.
<br><br>
When we actually descended the ladder it was found to be
very much like the lunar-gravity simulations we had performed
here on Earth. No difficulty was encountered in descending the
ladder. The last step was about 3 1/2 feet from the surface, and
we were somewhat concerned that we might have difficulty in
reentering the LM at the end of our activity period. So we
practiced that before bringing the camera down.

<img src="i11-7b.jpg" ALT="Footprint on surface of Moon"> 
<td valign=bottom><font size=2>
The dusty surface took footprints like
damp sand. Although superficicilly soft, it
proved remarkably resistant to penetration
by coring tubes, which generally hung up
after being driven a few inches.

<br>

ALDRIN: We opened the hatch and Neil, with me as his
navigator, began backing out of the tiny opening. It seemed like
a small eternity before I heard Neil say, "That's one small step
for man . . . one giant leap for mankind." In less than fifteen
minutes I was backing awkwardly out of the hatch and onto the
surface to join Neil, who, in the tradition of all tourists, had
his camera ready to photograph my arrival.

<td valign=bottom><font size=2>
The flag of Tranquility Base was not a symbol of territorial claim
so much as identification of the nation that had carried out the first
manned landing. Aldrin's forward-leaning stance here was the normal
resting position of an Astronaut wearing the big life-support pack.
Note eroded, half-buried rock in right foreground.

I felt buoyant and full of goose pimples when I stepped down
on the surface. I immediately looked down at my feet and became
intrigued with the peculiar properties of the lunar dust. If one
kicks sand on a beach, it scatters in numerous directions with
some grains traveling farther than others. On the Moon the dust
travels exactly and precisely as it goes in various directions,
and every grain of it lands nearly the same distance away.
