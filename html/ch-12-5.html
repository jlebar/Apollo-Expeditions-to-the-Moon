<h3>A LUNAR RICKSHAW</h3>

Ed and I worked on the surface for 4 hours and 50 minutes
during our first EVA; after the return to Antares, a long rest
period, and then resulting, we began the second EVA. This time we
had the MET- modularized equipment transporter, although we
called it the lunar rickshaw- to carry tools, cameras, and
samples so we could work more effectively and bring back a larger
quantity of samples.

The planned traverse route for the
second EVA is shown by a fine black
line an this map of the Apollo 14
site. The heavier white line is the
traverse actually covered. The craters 
and boulders encountered are
plotted, as are the locations of the
emplaced experiments. Such maps
are essential for an understanding of
the sample sources and the experiment 
data.

Our planned traverse was to take us from Antares more or
less due east to the rim of Cone crater. That traverse had been
chosen because scientists wanted samples and rocks from the
crater's rim. The theory is that the oldest rocks from deep under
the Moon's surface were thrown up and out of the crater by the
impact, and that the ones from the extreme depth of the crater
were to be found on the rim.
<br><br>
On our way to the crater, one of the first things Ed did was
to take a magnetometer reading at the first designated site. When
he read the numbers over the air, there was some excitement back
at Houston because the readings were about triple the values
gotten on Apollo 12. They were also higher than the values Stu
was reading in the Kitty Hawk, and so it seemed that the Moon's
magnetic field varied spatially.

The well-stocked tool rack at left,
which fitted neatly on the rickshaw,
was at least better than traipsing
about carrying everything, including
samples already collected. But it
proved to be a drag in deep dust,
easier to carry than to tow. The
problem of doing on-the-spot lunar
geologising in an efficient way
awaited the electric Rover.

Our first sampling began a little further on, in a rock
field with boulders about two or three feet along the major
dimension. These were located in the centers of a group of three
craters, each about sixty feet across. Like the bulk of the
samples brought back, these were documented samples. That means
photographing the soil or rocks, describing them and their
position over the voice link to Mission Control, and then putting
the sample in a numbered bag, identifying the bag at the same
time on the voice hookup.
<br><br>
Apollo 14 tried an experiment to do something constructive
about the dust that plagued all of the missions. NASA engineers
wanted to check out some of the finishes proposed for the Rover
and other pieces of operating equipment. I had a group of
samples - material chips with different finishes - and I dusted
them with the surface dust, shook them off, and then brushed one
set to try to determine the abrasive effects, if any, of such
dust removal. The other set was left unbrushed as a control
sample. All this was of course recorded with the closeup camera.
<br><br>
The mapped traverse was to take us nearly directly to the
rim of Cone crater, a feature about 1000 feet in diameter. As we
approached. the boulders got larger, up to four and five feet in
size. And at this time, the going started to get rough for us.
The terrain became more steep as we approached the rim, and the
increased grade accentuated the difficulty of walking in soft
dust.
