Gleaming in the sunlight, Spider and Gumdrop are hard-docked 
while two of the three-man
crew venture outside. CM pilot Dave Scott, breathing 
through an umbilical connection, pokes his
head out the command-module hatch. The picture 
was taken by LM pilot Rusty Schweickart (who
wore an independent life-support pack) while perched on 
the lunar module's "front porch".

The Apollo 9 and 10 missions were the learning phase of the
program, coming as they did between the first tests of the
command module in deep space on Apollo 8 and the lunar landing of
Apollo 11.
<br><br>
Apollo 9 and 10 were missions designed to rehearse all the
steps and reproduce all the events of the Apollo 11 mission with
the single exception of the lunar touchdown, stay, and liftoff.
The command and service modules and the lunar module were used in
flight procedures identical to those that would later take
similar vehicles to the Moon and a landing. The flight mechanics,
the mission support systems, the communications, the recording of
data - all these techniques and components were tested in a final
round of verification.
<br><br>
We learned from those two missions how to develop our flight
procedures. They are complex, at best, and for future missions we
wanted to know exactly what alternatives we would have under a
wide variety of circumstances to assure the safety of the
astronauts and the success of the missions, in that order.
Fortunately we had very few problems on both missions. Three
reasons for that good fortune were the extensive ground tests,
the simulation exercises which provided the crews with high-fidelity 
training for every phase of the flight, and the critical
design review procedures.
<br><br>
The crews rehearsed and re-rehearsed their movements in
ground simulators and in conditions of inflight weightlessness
produced by parabolic flights in a converted Air Force KC-135
tanker and by neutral buoyancy simulations. They had started this
kind of training as a crew months before the flight, gradually
working toward proficiency and a degree of automatic response to
the checklists, the pilots' shorthand notes that were developed
simultaneously. By the time they were ready for their actual
missions, they had run through all the normal routines many
times, and had thoroughly rehearsed emergency procedures for
every imaginable trouble or failure.
<br><br>
The critical design reviews were fundamental to the testing
and simulation programs. What we actually did was to go over
every single part of the spacecraft to make sure that we
understood how it worked, how it might go wrong, and what
alternative procedure or backup system we had in case it did go
wrong. The overriding consideration was, of course, crew safety;
there always had to be at least one way back from orbit or from
the Moon if something went wrong. These design reviews were done
by a number of task groups, because there were too many
spacecraft systems for any single group to consider, let alone
understand to the required degree.
<br><br>
One of my areas of special interest lay in what we called
software - the computer programs that provided the intelligence
and control functions onboard the spacecraft and at the ground
stations. General Phillips asked me to form a special software
review group that met for several months and initiated some
disciplines which, I believe, finally made it possible for the
Apollo 11 lunar landing to take place when it did.
<br><br>
An interesting point about the Apollo 10 flight is that it
did fail to do one of the steps that was later done on the Apollo
11 and which caused some brief moments of tension just before the
lunar landing. On Apollo 10, the landing radar and the rendezvous
radar never were operated at the same time. They are used for two
different procedures, and at two different altitudes, so that
there didn't seem to be any need for simultaneous operation of
the pair. But on Apollo 11, they wanted to check the operation of
the high-altitude gate radar as they approached the surface of
the Moon, and so it was left on. That radar and the landing radar
were feeding information directly into the onboard computer in
the Apollo 11 lunar module. Although the data from the altitude
radar was not being used, it nevertheless was driving the input
registers of the computer and thus forcing the central processor
to decide at each cycle that the radar data were not germane.
