  <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
  <h3>FOREWORD</h3>
  <hr><br>
</center>

No nation ever demonstrated its aspirations and abilities as 
dramatically as did the United States when it landed the first men on 
the Moon, or as much in public: More people on Earth watched that first 
small step on a foreign planet than had witnessed any prior event in the 
ascent of man.  While it is still too early to assess the full 
significance of that remarkable undertaking, I think it is a good time 
to look back on the total enterprise, while the images are still sharp, 
and while those concerned are available to give testimony. Historians 
have observed that ventures into uncharted waters are often illuminated 
most vividly in the words of those who were there; one thinks of Caesar's 
<i>Commentaries</i>, Bradford's <i>History of Plymouth Plantation</i>, 
Darwin's <i>Voyage of the Beagle</i>. An interesting parallel exists 
between the voyages of <i>H.M.S. Beagle</i> and the missions of Apollo: 
One changed the course of the biological sciences, and the others are 
reshaping planetary and Earth sciences. In this volume you will find the 
personal accounts of eighteen men who, like Darwin, were much involved 
in long and influential voyages.
<br><br>
New scientific insights are an important part of the legacy of Apollo, 
as well as the worldwide lift to the human spirit that the achievement 
generated.  But there is a third legacy of Apollo that is particularly 
germane today. This was the demonstration that great and difficult 
endeavors can be conducted successfully by a steadfast mobilization of 
national will and resources. Today we face seemingly intractable
problems whose resolution may call for similar mobilization of resources 
and will. Husbanding the planet's finite resources, developing its energy 
supplies, feeding its billions, protecting its environment, and shackling 
its weapons are some of these problems. If the zest, drive, and 
dedication that made Apollo a success can be brought to bear, that may 
be the most priceless legacy of Apollo.

  <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
  <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
  <hr><br>
</center>

In looking back at the origins and development of the Apollo program, one word
that comes to mind is <i>action</i>. From my vantage as Associate Administrator 
from 1960 to 1965, and then as Deputy Administrator from 1965 to 1968, I had an 
excellent picture of the intricate action processes that comprised the Apollo program.  
Disparate and numerous, the actions and their companion reactions came together in 
a remarkably coordinated and cooperative blending for the goal of placing men on 
the Moon and bringing them back safely.
<br><br>
The precipitating action was the successful Soviet launching of Sputnik in 1957.
This remarkable and surprising achievement was the impetus for NASA's creation in
1958 by President Eisenhower and the Congress. Forced in large part from the widely
respected National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, with its valued research
facilities in Virginia, Ohio, and California, NASA also incorporated other research
elements. From the Navy came the Vanguard Satellite Project team. From the Army
came the ballistic missile team at Redstone Arsenal, to become the nucleus of the
Marshall Space Flight Center. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, operated by the 
California Institute of Technology for the Defense Department, was also made part 
of the growing NASA organization.
<br><br>
During the NACA-NASA transition period the elements of Project Mercury for
placing a manned capsule in orbit were born. Work also began, and progressed well, on
scientific, meteorological, and communication satellites - themselves considerable
examples of technological virtuosity - but interest remained high on manned space
flight. Estimates of the technical problems and price tag for a manned lunar landing
mission were forbidding. The understandable reluctance to make such a major 
commitment diminished dramatically, however, with Gagarin's successful manned 
orbital flight in March 1961. Again, as in the period following Sputnik, grave 
concern about Soviet successes was vocalized in the Congress and President Kennedy 
asked his administration for plans to make this Nation preeminent in space.  Out of 
this introspection came plans and a favorable response to President Kennedy's special 
address to Congress in which he stated: "I believe this Nation should commit itself 
to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and 
returning him safely to Earth." But as we were to learn in carrying out this objective, 
sustaining the resources meant renewing the commitment annually. The Congress tends 
to operate with fiscal-year and session perspective; while our horizon was set nine 
years ahead. We found that an agency's performance as a good steward of public funds 
is a keystone to its continued support.
<br><br>
As planning for Apollo began, we identified more than 10,000 separate tasks
that had to be accomplished to put a man on the Moon. Each task had its particular
objectives, its manpower needs, its time schedule, and its complex interrelationship
with many other tasks.  Which had to be done first?  Which could be done concurrently?
What were the critical sequences? Vital questions such as these had to be answered
in building the network of tasks leading to a lunar landing. The network had to be
subdivided into manageable portions, the key ones being: determination of the 
environment in cislunar space and on the lunar surface; the design and development 
of the spacecraft and launch vehicles, the conduct of tests and flight missions to 
prove these components and procedures; and the selection and training of flight 
crews and ground support to carry out the missions.
<br><br>
Early in the critical planning stages for Apollo, three different approaches to the
Moon were considered: direct ascent, rendezvous in Earth orbit, and rendezvous in
lunar orbit. The choice of mission mode was a key milestone in our development of
Apollo. Like many other decisions, it set us in a direction from which retreat could
come only at extreme penalty to the schedule and cost of the program.
<br><br>
Lunar-orbit rendezvous meant considerable payload savings and in turn a reduced
propulsion requirement; in fact the reduction was on the order of 50 percent.  
But in requiring less brute force we needed more skill and finesse. A module 
designed especially for landing on and lifting from the lunar surface had to mate 
with a module orbiting the Moon. Rendezvous and docking, clearly, were of critical 
importance. The Gemini program was created to provide greater experience than 
Mercury would in manned operations in space, and especially in perfecting procedures 
on rendezvous and docking.
<br><br>
While lunar rendezvous was the choice for getting to the Moon, many other
fundamental technical, policy, and management questions had to be answered:
How and where were major parts to be developed and made? How were they to be
shipped? Where were they to be assembled? Where would we site the important 
supporting facilities and the launch complex? The huge scale of the Apollo operation
precluded conventional answers. Facilities that were in themselves major engineering
challenges were created, and a separate network of giant deep-space antennas was 
constructed in Spain, Australia, and California to receive the tremendous volume 
of data that would flow back from the Moon.
<br><br>
Apollo was an incredible mixture of the large and the small, of huge structures
and miniaturized equipment. These astronomical variations in scale had to be dealt
with in a thoroughgoing way, with technical competence and managerial assurance.
In planning the serial buildup of Apollo missions, we could not take steps so small
that the exposure to the ever-present risk outweighed minor gains expected. Yet 
neither could we take steps so big that we stretched equipment and people dangerously 
far beyond the capabilities that had already been demonstrated. We followed the 
fundamental policy of capitalizing on success, always advancing on each mission as 
rapidly as good judgment dictated.
<br><br>
So step by step, confidence and experience were accumulated. The four manned
orbital flights of the Mercury procyram proved man's ability to survive in space, 
fly spacecraft, and perform experiments. These abilities were expanded in the Gemini
program; in particular, the ability to rendezvous, dock, and conduct extravehicular
activity was demonstrated. The Ranger, Surveyor, and Orbiter series contributed 
necessary cartographic, geologic, and geophysical data about the Moon. All these 
missions were in preparation for the flights with the powerful Saturn V launch 
vehicle first flown unmanned in late 1967.
<br><br>
Throughout the program we tried to maintain a flexible posture, keeping as many
options open as possible. When difficulties were experienced and delays occurred,
alternate plans had to be quickly but carefully evaluated. This meant there was a
continual need for steady judgement and cool decision. Apollo managers and 
astronauts met that need. The Apollo 8 flight was an example of the virtue of 
schedule flexibility. Lunar-module progress had slowed and the Lunar Orbiter 
spacecraft had revealed unexpected circumlunar navigational questions. Our action 
was to send the command and service modules alone into lunar orbit. And so in 
December 1968 man first flew to the neighborhood of the Moon. Apollo 8 was indeed 
a significant Christmas gift for the program.
<br><br>
To acquire critical rendezvous and docking experience, Apollo 9 flight-tested
the whole system, booster, command and service module, and lunar module in Earth
orbit. Could we next put it all together and land on the Moon? Was the step too big?
Would it stretch us too far? Yes, it would, we concluded. To resolve the remaining
unknowns, astronauts again went to the Moon, not yet to land, but to do as many of
the required nonlanding tasks as possible. Apollo 10 was a successful dress 
rehearsal.
<br><br>
Throughout the testing, both ground and flight, we played deadly serious "what-if"
games - designed to anticipate contingencies and cope successfully with them. 
Computers were invaluable aids to these simulation exercises. Out of these efforts 
came the experience and team coherence that were the backbone of Apollo's success.  
Out of these efforts came the ability to adjust to the spurious computer alarms 
during Apollo 11's descent, to the lightning bolt during the launch of Apollo 12, 
and to the ruptured oxygen tank on Apollo 13. From the first step of a man onto the 
Moon in Apollo 11 to the last departing step in Apollo 17, we showed that enormously 
difficult large endeavors can succeed, given the willingness, discipline, and 
competence of a dedicated crew of gifted people.
<br><br>
My vantage point in NASA gave me one perspective of the Apollo program's
development. As you read this volume you will get other perspectives and insights 
from key participants in the program. I'm sure you will sense in their writing the 
exhilaration and pride they justifiably feel in their roles in the Apollo expeditions 
of the Moon. From my present vantage point as Administrator of the Energy Research 
and Development Administration I see more clearly that Apollo was as much a triumph 
of organization as of anything else. It was essential that we had the support of the 
President and the Congress, the participation of many accomplished scientists and 
engineers, and the continuing interest of the public at large. No single Government 
agency nor institution nor corporation can perform alone the tasks associated with 
reaching major national objectives. Apollo was an outstanding example of how 
governmental agencies, industrial firms, and universities can work together to 
reach seemingly impossible goals.

<h2>A Perspective on Apollo</h2>

<h4>By JAMES E. WEBB</h4>
<br>

After hundreds of thousands of years of occupancy, and several thousand years
of recorded history, man quite suddenly left the planet Earth in 1969 to fly to 
its nearest neighbor, the Moon. The ten-year span it took to accomplish this task 
was but a blink of an eye on an evolutionary scale, but the impact of the event will 
permanently affect man's destiny.

<font size=4><i>THE ARTIST LOOKS AT SPACE<br><br>
Dozens of America's artists were invited by NASA Administrator James E. Webb to
record the strange new world of space. Although an intensive use of photography 
had long characterized NASA's work, the Agency recognized the special ability of 
the artist's eye to select and interpret what might go unseen by the literal 
camera lens.
<br>
No civilian  government agency had ever sponsored as comprehensive and 
unrestricted an art program before. A sampling of the many paintings and drawings 
that resulted is presented in this chapter.

<br>

In reflecting on the Apollo program, I am sometimes overwhelmed at the sheer
magnitude of the task and the temerity of its undertaking. When Apollo was conceived,
a lunar landing was considered so difficult that it could only be accomplished through
exceptional large-scale efforts in science, in engineering, and in the development 
of operational and training systems for long-duration manned flights. These clearly 
required the application of large resources over a decade.
<br><br>
Industry, universities, and government elements had to be melded into a team of
teams. Apollo involved competition for world leadership in the understanding and
mastery of rocketry, of spacecraft development and use, and of new departures of 
international cooperation in science and technology. Like the Bretton Woods monetary
agreement, President Truman's Point Four Program, and the Marshall Plan, the Apollo
program was a further attempt toward world stability - but with a new thrust.
<br><br>
This chapter will review the origins of this policy and how it was successfully 
implemented. Subsequent chapters describe how particular problems were solved, how 
the astronauts and other teams of specialists were trained and performed, how the 
giant spaceboosters were built and flown, and how all this was joined together in a 
fully integrated effort. In many of these essays you will find indications of the 
meaning of the Apollo program to those who devoted much of their lives to it.
<br><br>
In the pre-space years the main defensive shield of the free world against 
Communist expansion was the preeminence of the United States in aeronautical 
technology and nuclear weaponry. These were an integral part of a system of 
mutual-defense treaties with other non-Communist nations.

<h3>A PERSPECTIVE ON APOLLO 1</h3>

In the 1950s, when the U.S.S.R. demonstrated rocket engines powerful enough to carry 
atomic weapons over intercontinental distances, it became clear to United States
and free world political and military leaders that we had to add technological 
strength in rocketry and know-how in the use of space systems to our defense base if 
we were to play a decisive role in world affairs.

</center>
<br>

In the United States the first decision was to give this job to our military services.
They did it well. Atlas, Titan, Minuteman, and Polaris missiles rapidly added rocket
power to the basic air and atomic power that we were pledged to use to support 
longheld objectives of world stability, peace, and progress.
<br><br>

The establishment of the Atomic Energy Commission as a civilian agency had
emphasized in the 1940s our hope that nuclear technology could become a major force
for peaceful purposes as well as for defense. In 1958 the establishment of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, again as a civilian agency, emphasized 
our hope that space could be developed for peaceful purposes.
NASA was specifically charged with the expansion into space of our high level
of aeronautical know-how. It was made responsible for research and development that
would both increase our space know-how for military use, if needed, and would enlarge
our ability to use space in cooperation with other nations for "peaceful purposes 
for the benefit of all mankind."

<h3>A FERMENT OF DEBATE</h3>

The Apollo program grew out of a ferment of imaginative thought and public
debate. Long-range goals and priorities within our governmental, quasi-governmental,
and private institutions were agreed on. Leaders in political, scientific, 
engineering, and many other endeavors participated. Debate focused on such questions 
as which should come first - increasing scientific knowledge or using man-machine 
combinations to extend both our knowledge of science and lead to advances in 
engineering? Should we concentrate on purely scientific unmanned missions?  Should 
such practical uses of space as weather observations and communication relay stations 
have priority? Was it more vital to concentrate on increasing our military strength, 
or to engage in spectacular prestige-building exploits?

<br>

In the turbulent 1960s, Apollo flights proved that man can leave his earthly home
with its friendly and protective atmosphere to travel out toward the stars and 
explore other parts of the solar system. In the 1970s the significance of this new 
capability is still not clear. Will there be a basic shift of power here on Earth to 
the nation that first achieves dominance in space? Can we maintain our desired 
progress toward a prosperous peaceful world if we allow ourselves to be outclassed 
in this new technology? Policymakers in Congress, the White House, the State and 
Defense Departments, the National Science Foundation, the Atomic Energy Commission, 
NASA, and other agencies agreed in the 1960s that we should develop national 
competence to operate large space systems repetitively and reliably. It was also 
agreed that this should be done in full public view in cooperation with all nations 
desiring to participate. However, this consensus was not unanimous. Critics thought 
that the Apollo program was too vast and costly, too great a drain on our 
scientific, engineering, and productive resources, too fraught with 
danger, and contended that automatic unmanned machines could
accomplish everything necessary.

Specialized groups frequently overlooked the multiple objectives of developing 
a means of transporting astronauts to and from the Moon.  Some manned spaceflight
enthusiasts deplored NASA's simultaneous emphasis on flights to build a solid 
base of scientific knowledge of space.  Some critics failed to recognize the 
value of having trained men make on-site observations, measurements, and 
judgments about lunar phenomena, and sending men to place scientific instruments 
where they could best answer specific questions.

<br>

A vast array of government agencies participated in the network of 
decision-making from which the basic policies that governed the Apollo program 
evolved. Collaboration between academic and industrial contributors required 
procedures that often seemed burdensome to scientists and enerineers.  Even some astronauts failed at
times to appreciate the potential benefits of precise knowledge as to the effect of
weightlessness and spaceflight stress on their bodies.  Fortunately our Nation's most
thoughtful leaders recognized the necessity as well as the complexity of the various
components of NASA's work and strongly endorsed the Apollo program. It is a tribute
to the innate good sense of our citizens that enough of a consensus was obtained to see
the effort through to success.

<h3>THE GOAL OF APOLLO</h3>

The Apollo requirement was to take off from a point on the surface of the Earth
that was traveling 1000 miles per hour as the Earth rotated, to go into orbit at 18,000
miles an hour, to speed up at the proper time to 25,000 miles an hour, to travel to a
body in space 240,000 miles distant which was itself traveling 2000 miles per hour
relative to the Earth, to go into orbit around this body, and to drop a specialized landing 
vehicle to its surface. There men were to make observations and measurements,
collect specimens, leave instruments that would send back data on what was found, and
then repeat much of the outward-bound process to get back home.  One such expedition
would not do the job. NASA had to develop a reliable system capable of doing this time
after time.

</center>
<br>

At the time the decision was made, how to do most of this was not known.  But
there were people in NASA, in the Department of Defense, in American universities,
and in American industry who had the basic scientific knowledge and technical 
know-how needed to predict realistically that it <i>could be done</i>.

<br>

Apollo was based on the accumulation of knowledge from years of work in military 
and civil aviation, on work done to meet our urgent military needs in rocketry, and
on a basic pattern of cooperation between government, industry, and universities that
had proven successful in NASA's parent organization, the National Advisory Committee 
for Aeronautics.  The space agency built on and expanded the pattern that had
yielded success in the past.

Systems engineering and systems management were developed to high efficiency.
So was project management.  New ways to achieve high reliability in complex machines
were worked out. New ways to conduct nondestructive testing were developed. The best
of large-scale management theory and doctrine was used to bring together both 
organizational (or administrative) optimization and join it to responsibility to 
work within the constraints of accepted organizational behavior.

<h3>LARGE ISSUES OF POLICY</h3>

In 1961, when President Kennedy asked me to join his administration as head
of NASA, I demurred and advised him to appoint a scientist or engineer.  
The President
strongly disagreed.  At a time when rockets were becoming so powerful that they could
open up "the new ocean of space", he saw this Nation's most important needs as involving 
many large issues of national and international policy.  He pointed to my experience
in working with President Truman in the Bureau of the Budget and with Secretary
Acheson in the State Department as well as to my experience in aviation and education
as his reasons for asking me to take the job.  Vice President Johnson also held this view,
and emphasized the value of my experience with high-technology companies in the
business world.

<br>

I could not refuse this challenge, and I found that large issues of policy were
indeed to occupy much of my energy. How could NASA, in the Executive Branch, do
its work so as to facilitate responsible legislative actions in the Congress? How could
public interest in space be made a constructive force? How could other nations' help be
assured?  In resolving policy and program questions, NASA was fortunate that
Dr. Hugh Dryden, as Deputy Administrator, and Dr. Robert Seamans, as Associate
Administrator, also had backgrounds of varied experience that could bring great wisdom 
to the decisions. We early formed a close relationship and stood together in all
that was done.
<br><br>
Soon after my appointment, several significant events occurred in rapid succession.  
The first was a thorough review with Dr. Dryden and Dr. Seamans of what had
been learned in both aeronautics and rocketry since NASA had been formed in 1958
to make projections of these advances into the future. We examined the adequacy of
NASA's long-range plans and made estimates of the kind of scientific and engineering
progress that would be required. We reviewed estimates of cost and found that sufficient 
priority and funds had not been provided.

<br>

The second event was the U.S.S.R.'s successful launch of the first man into Earth
orbit, the Gagarin flight on April 12, 1961. A few weeks before this spectacular 
demonstration of the U.S.S.R.'s competence in rocketry, NASA had appealed to President
Kennedy to reverse his earlier decision to postpone the manned spaceflight projects
that were planned as a followup to the Mercury program. In his earlier decision, President 
Kennedy had approved funds for larger rocket engines but not for development
of a new Generation of man-rated boosters and manned spacecraft. The "talking paper"
that I used to urge President Kennedy to support manned flight included the following:
<br><br>
"The U.S. civilian space effort is based on a ten-year plan. When prepared in
1960, this ten-year plan was designed to go hand-in-hand with our military programs.
The U.S. procrastination for a number of years had been based in part on a very real
skepticism as to the necessity for the large expenditures required, and the validity of
the goals sought through the space effort."

"In the preparation of the 1962 budget, President Eisenhower reduced the $1.35
billion requested by the space agency to the extent of $240 million and specifically
eliminated funds to proceed with manned spaceflight beyond Mercury. This decision
emasculated the [NASA] ten-year plan before it was even one year old, and, unless
reversed, guarantees that the Russians will, for the next five to ten years, beat us to
every spectacular exploratory flight...."

as possible our capability for boosting large spacecraft into orbit, since this is our

President Kennedy's March decision had been to proceed cautiously. He had
added $126 million to NASA's budget, mostly for engines, but postponed the start on
manned spacecraft. In March of 1961, he was not yet ready to move unambiguously
toward a resolution of the great national and international policy issues about which he
spoke when he asked me to join the administration.

<h3>KENNEDY'S DECISION</h3>

Gagarin's successful one-orbit flight in Vostok in April 1961 changed Presidential
caution into concern and resulted in the Apollo decision.
A thoughtful scholar, Dr. John Logsdon, has described the situation in these
words:

<br><br>
<center>
<table border=0><tr><td>

</center>
<br>

"The Soviet Union was quick to capitalize on the propaganda significance of the
Gagarin flight. In his first telephone conversation with Gagarin, Nikita Khrushchev
boasted, 'Let the capitalist countries catch up with our country.' The Communist Party
claimed that in this achievement 'are embodied the genius of the Soviet people and the
powerful force of socialism.' . . . Soviet propaganda stressed three themes: 
<ol>
<li>The Gagarin flight was evidence of the virtues of 'victorious socialism'; 
<li>the flight was evidence of the global superiority of the Soviet Union in 
all aspects of science and technology; 
<li>the Soviet Union, despite the ability to translate this superiority into
powerful military weapons, wants world peace and general disarmament."
</ol>

"New York Times correspondent Harry Schwartz suggested that it appeared likely
'that the Soviet leaders hope their space feat can further alter the atmosphere of 
international relations so as to create more pressure on Western governments to make 
concessions on the great world issues of the present day.' "
<br><br>
Logsdon also wrote: ". . . the events of April produced a time of crisis, a time in
which a sense of urgency motivated space planners and government policymakers to
reexamine our national space goals and space programs. This reexamination resulted
in a presidential decision to use the United States space program as an instrument of
national strategy, rather than to view it primarily as a program of scientific research.
This decision identified, for the world to see, a space achievement as a national goal
symbolic of American determination to remain the leading power in the world."

There were, of course, many other elements of national policy and commitment,
but it is not easy to relate them to any one event such as the Gagarin flight. Continued
Congressional understanding and support was the product of years of work by 
outstanding legislative leaders, and by devoted committee members and staffs. Cooperation
and participation by Department of Defense elements and leaders were essential and
are shown throughout this volume.

<h3>WORKING WITH INDUSTRIES AND UNIVERSITIES</h3>

There is another event, however, that relates to what was done and how NASA
proceeded with Apollo.  This event was a visit from a sophisticated senior official of a
large corporation holding many aerospace contracts. He hit me right between the eyes
with the question: "In the award of contracts are you going to follow 100 percent the
reports of your technical experts, or are there going to be political influences in these
awards?" My answer was just as direct: "In choosincy contractors and supervising our
industrial partners, we are going to take into account every factor that we should take
into account as responsible government officials."

<br><br>

<br>

This meant that NASA officials would be required to meet President Kennedy's
basic guideline - that we would not limit our decisions to technical factors but would
work with American industry in the knowledge that we were together dealing with factors 
basic to "broad national and international policy". This also became our basic
guideline for relations with universities and with scientists in the many disciplines that
became so important a part of Apollo.
<br><br>
We constantly endeavored to set our course so that all who participated in Apollo
could grow stronger for their own purposes at the same time that they were doing the
work to succeed in NASA's projects. As they worked under NASA support, we were
determined not to deplete their capability to achieve those goals that were important
to them. In essence, our policy was to help them build strength so they could add to the
Nation's strength.
<br><br>
Historians will find many lessons in the Apollo program for the managers of
future large-scale enterprises. It was a new kind of national venture. Suddenly and
dramatically it brought men of action and men of thought into intimate working 
relationships designed to solve a large number of extremely difficult scientific and 
technical problems. It was a major challenge to legislators, scientists, and engineers.
<br><br>
After a careful study of the way we conducted our work, Dr. Leonard R. Sayles
and Dr. Margaret K. Chandler of the Graduate School of Business at Columbia 
University wrote:
<br><br>
"NASA's most significant contribution is in the area of advanced systems design:
getting an organizationally complex structure, involving a great variety of people doing
a great variety of things in many separate locations, to do what you want, when you
want it - and while the decision regarding the best route to your objective is still 
in the process of being made by you and your collaborators."

<br>

Although our goal was clear and unambiguous, to reach it we had to use rapidly
developing technology that in turn was based on rapidly increasing scientific knowledge.  
This required our organization to be highly flexible, and it was altered when
unexpected developments made this necessary. As Mercury phased into Gemini, and
Apollo reached its peak effort, NASA's work force grew to 390,000 men and women
in industry, 33,000 in NASA Centers, and 10,000 in universities. By 1969, the year
of the first lunar landing, this total had been reduced by 190,000. By 1974, it was
down to 126,000. This is certainly an administrative record.
<br><br>
No more flights to the Moon are scheduled now, and future ones will undoubtedly
be made differently, but the Apollo program has not really ended. Instruments placed
on the Moon by the American astronauts are still transmitting important data to 
scientists throughout the world. We know much about how the Moon is bound to the
Earth by invisible gravitational fields, and how both are similarly bound to the star
we call the Sun. Daily, men and women are learning more about that star, and about
the whole universe.

<h3>BENEFITS FROM SPACE TECHNOLOGY</h3>

No one can yet fully appraise the ultimate benefits from this historic achievement.
Many of the technical innovations necessary for men to go to the Moon and back have
already been embodied in everyday processes and products. These range from versatile
electronic computers to fireproof bedding in hospitals and special equipment for the
handicapped. More applications of information acquired from space research are 
continually being reported.

Possibly more significantly, the idea that if we can go to the Moon we can accomplish 
other feats long considered impossible has been firmly implanted in people's
minds. Confidence that solutions can be found to such urgent problems as an energy
shortage, environmental degradation, and strife between nations, has been nourished
by this spectacular demonstration in space of man's capabilities.
<br><br>
Apollo was a multidimensional success, triumphant not only as a feat of scientific
and engineering precision, but also as a demonstration of our country's spirit and
competence. In the worldwide reaction at the time of the lunar landing, it was clear
that this great adventure transcended nationality and became a milestone for mankind.
Every participant in the Apollo program saw a slightly different facet of it. While
reading these personal accounts and studying these pictures, you will possibly perceive
more clearly the motives, the hazards faced, and the triumphs that first enabled men
to set foot on the Moon.

<h2>"I Believe We Should Go to the Moon"</h2>

<h4>By ROBERT R. GILRUTH</h4>
<br>

<center>
<table border=0><tr><td>
<img src="i-2-1.jpg" ALT="A photo of President John F. Kennedy giving a speech to Congress and the nation"> 
</table>
<table border=0 width=70%><tr><td>&nbsp;<tr><td align=center><font size=2>
Speaking to Congress and the Nation, President Kennedy said on
May 25, 1961: "I believe that this nation should commit itself to
achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on
the Moon and returning him safely to Earth. No single space project
in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important 
in the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so
difficult or expensive to accomplish."
</table>
</center>

<br><br>
President Kennedy's statement, "Fly man to the Moon in this decade," was a
beautiful definition of the task. There could be no misunderstanding as to just what
was desired, and this clarity of purpose was one factor in the success of Apollo. By
definition, it settled the old question of man versus instrument, and it provided a goal
so difficult that new concepts, as well as new designs, would be required to accomplish
it. Since the landing was geared to the decade of the sixties, the pace of the program
was also defined, and a clear test of strength with the Soviets was implicit, if they chose
to compete.
<br><br>
The President's decision came after a long series of Russian firsts. They were the
first to orbit the Earth, and the first to send instruments to the Moon; only a month
earlier, Yuri Gagarin had become the first man in space. Alan Shepard had followed
Gagarin into space by only a few weeks to become the first American in space. This
feat had given America the feeling that, with a major effort, we might close the gap
with the Soviets. The public was ready and willing to expand the space effort, and Congress 
did not bat an eye at Webb's estimate that $20 to $40 billion could be required
to go to the Moon. It was a popular decision, and the vote of the Congress on the Moon
program was virtually unanimous.
<br><br>
But could it really be done? Flying man to the Moon required an enormous advance 
in the science of flight in a very short time. Even the concepts of manned spaceflight 
were only three years old, and voyaging in space over such vast distances was
still just a dream. Rendezvous, docking, prolonged weightlessness, radiation, and the
meteoroid hazard all involved problems of unknown dimensions. We would need giant
new rockets burning high-energy hydrogen; a breakthrough in reliability; new methods
of staging and handling; and the ability to launch on time, since going to the Moon
required the accurate hitting of launch windows.
<br><br>
Man himself was a great unknown. At the time of the President's decision we had
only Alan Shepard's brief 15 minutes of flight on which to base our knowledge. Could
man really function on a two-week mission that would involve precise maneuvers, 
including retrofire into lunar orbit, backing down and landing on the Moon, lunar take-off, 
midcourse corrections on the way home and, finally, a high-speed reentry into
Earth's atmosphere, performed with a precision so far unknown in vehicle guidance?
We would have to do intensive work on spacesuit development, since flying to the Moon
would be unthinkable without giving astronauts the capability of exploring the Moon
on foot, and perhaps later in some roving vehicle. These men would have to be trained
in the complex problems of flying and navigating in space, and we would need a cadre
of men with space experience before setting out on such a voyage.
<br><br>
On the spacecraft side, we felt that the concepts already under trial in Project
Mercury would be applicable for the command and service module, but we would need
new sources of onboard power such as the fuel cell. The landing on the Moon would
require precision guidance, as well as good visibility from the cabin for the astronauts,
and a graduated control of rocket thrust heretofore undeveloped. The state of the art
in tracking and communication would be severely tested. Precision navigation techniques 
using inertial systems would be necessary, and high-speed computing for solving
complex navigation problems involving the celestial mechanics of three-body systems.
The mass ratios involved in the spacecraft, particularly the lunar lander, would require
the ultimate in materials. Safety factors would have to be stretched in order to give the
low structural weights required. And in the spacecraft, as well as the launch vehicle,
new orders of reliability would be required for so long a mission so far from home.
<br><br>
The Moon itself was a great unknown. Its surface, its mass distribution, and
whether the lunar soil would be firm enough to support a landing craft were all open to
conjecture. Finally, a master plan had to be evolved. The launch site had to be selected,
roles and missions of government centers had to be determined, and a choice had to be
made between the various concepts of how to go to the Moon, whether to use Earth-orbit 
rendezvous, direct ascent, or the most controversial of all, lunar-orbit rendezvous.
A government team had to be built that, working closely together with leaders of industry, 
would manage the development and production of the launch vehicles, the
spacecraft, and facilities for tests and operations. Not only would all these things have
to be done in the short time available, but many would have to be worked out at the
beginning, during what I have called "the year of decisions."

  <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
  <h3>CHAPTER 2.2</h3>
  <hr><br>
</center>

<h3>WHAT WE HAD TO BUILD ON</h3>

Many of our key people in Apollo I, particularly on the spacecraft side, grew out of
the old NACA, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. We had the heritage 
of the airplane to work from, with all its methods of design, test, and operation.
For the ballistic-missile programs of the early 1950s we had helped to develop solutions 
for reentry problems that were to have direct application to spacecraft design. But
it was the launching of Sputnik I in October 1957 that put a new sense of value and
urgency on the things we were doing. When one month later, the dog Laika was placed
in orbit in Sputnik II, I was sure that the Russians were planning for man in space.
<br><br>
It seemed to me that the United States would surely enter into space competition
with the Soviet Union, and flying man into space would be a legitimate national goal.

<br>

The Russians were ahead. A month after the 184-pound 
Sputnik I, they sent up the dog Laika (above left) in
the 1120-pound Sputnik II. Three years later, on April
12, 1961, Yuri Gagarin (above right and below) became the
first man to orbit the Earth. His Vostok I's payload
was 10,417 pounds and his flight lasted 108 minutes.
At this time, the United States was in the final stage of
preparing for its first manned suborbital flight, on
May 5, 1961. The physical hazards of weightlessness
were then almost wholly unknown.

</center>

<br>
Thus it was that our small but creative group in NACA started working intensively on
spacecraft-design problems. Most of the effort in those early days had been directed
toward hypersonic gliders, or winged vehicles, that would fly at high Mach numbers
and perhaps even into orbit. But our views were changing, and Harvey Allen of the
Ames Laboratory was the first, to my recollection, to propose a blunt body for flying
man in space. He suggested a sphere to enclose the man and said, "you just throw it",
meaning, of course, launch it into space with a rocket. In March 1958, Max Faget presented 
a paper that was to be a milestone in spacecraft design. His paper proposed a
simple blunt-body vehicle that would reenter the atmosphere without reaching heating
rates or accelerations that would be dangerous to man. He showed that small retro-rockets 
were adequate to initiate reentry from orbit. He suggested the use of parachutes
for final descent, and small attitude jets for controlling the capsule in orbit during retrofire 
and reentry. His paper concluded with a statement that: "As far as reentry and recovery 
are concerned, the state of the art is sufficiently advanced to proceed confidently
with a manned satellite project based upon the use of a blunt-body vehicle."

Engineers brainstormed many
ideas. These sketches illustrate
some of them. In the upper left a
spacecraft is shown still attached
to its booster. It has jettisoned nose
fairings and deployed its antenna.
The drawing to the right of it
shows the jettisoning of spent
retrorockets as the spacecraft 
reenters the atmosphere. For reentry
the blunt end is pointed in the 
direction of travel, thus serving as a
heat shield. In the lower left sketch
the heat shield is jettisoned just 
before splashdown. The final sketch
shows the spacecraft floating
safely in the water as an astronaut
waves to the recovery team. 
Caldwell C. Johnson sketched these
concepts in May 1958.
</table>
</center>

<br>
Starting with the formation of NASA in October 1958, intense efforts were undertaken 
to create a manned space vehicle and flight organization capabie of flying man
in orbit around the Earth. The plans for this vehicle were based on the blunt reentry
body proposed earlier by Harvey Allen and Max Faget. A special team, the Space Task
Group, was formed at Langley Field, Virginia, to manage this effort, and the McDonnell 
Aircraft Corporation won the competition to build what would be the Mercury
spacecraft.
<br><br>

<table border=0><tr><td>
<img src="i2-3b.jpg" ALT="Diagram of a capsule">

<table border=0 width=50%><tr><td>&nbsp;<tr><td align=center><font size=2>
Tests, redesigns, and more tests led to this
basic configuration for manned spaceflight.
A special escape system would pull the man
from an exploding booster. Lying on a tailored 
couch, he would best withstand the
g-loads of launch, abort, and atmospheric
reentry.
</table>
</center>
<br>

The heat shield was a slightly convex surface constructed of plastic and fiberglass
material that would give out gas under intense heat, protecting itself from destruction.
The conical afterbody was covered by shingles of high-temperature alloy similar to that
used in turbine blades of jet engines. These shingles were insulated from the titanium
pressure shell and they dissipated their heat by radiation. Parachutes were by far the
lightest and most reliable means of making the final descent to Earth, and the parachute 
section was protected from heat by shingles of beryllium. Another key factor in
the Mercury design was the supine couch for the astronaut. There had been considerable 
doubt that man could withstand the g-loads associated with rocket launching and
reentry, particularly in abort situations. The form-fitting couch gave such well-distributed 
support that man could withstand over 20g without injury or permanent damage.
<br><br>
This concept of the Mercury capsule and, indeed, the whole plan for putting rnan
into space was remarkable in its elegant simplicity. Yet its very daring and unconventional 
approach made it the subject of considerable controversy. Some people felt that
such a means for flying man in space was only a stunt. The blunt body in particular
was under fire since it was such a radical departure from the airplane. It was called by
its opponents "the man in the can," and the pilot was termed only a medical specimen.
Even Dr. Dryden, at the time the Director of NACA, labeled one early ballistic-capsule
proposal the same as shooting a young lady from a cannon. However, he approved the
Project Mercury design, since it was by then a complete system for orbital flight. The
Mercury spacecraft and, in fact, Gemini and Apollo as well, were designed to land on
the water because of the large water area which lay east of Cape Canaveral over the
South Atlantic. lf an abort were required during launch, the spacecraft would have to
survive a water landing; and this therefore became the best way to make all landings.
It was easier to attenuate landing-impact forces in water landings, although the spacecraft 
was designed to survive a land impact without harm to flight crews.
<br><br>
The first astronauts were brought onboard the Mercury program in April 1959.
They were volunteer military pilots, graduates of test pilot schools. Each was required
to have a bachelor's degree in engineering or equivalent, and at least 1500 hours of jet
time. Of the first group of 60 candidates called to Washington to hear about the program, 
more than 80 percent volunteered. All were of such high caliber that selection
was difficult. However, I picked seven: three Air Force, three Navy, and one Marine,
on the basis that the Mercury program would probably not give more than this number
a chance to fly. These men were true pioneers. They volunteered at a time when our
plans were only on paper and when no one really knew what the chance of success was.
One had to respect their motivation and courage.

<br><br>
We were to have many spectacular successes as well as failures in the Mercury
program. However, we were able to learn from each failure, and fortunate in having
these failures early in the program so that the astronauts and the animal passengers as
weil were flown without mishap when their time came. Perhaps our most spectacular
failure in Mercury came to be known as the "tower flight". In this sad affair, the escape
tower, the parachutes, and the peroxide fuel were all deployed on the launching pad in
front of the domestic and international press. A relatively simple ground-circuit defect
in the Redstone launch vehicle caused the main rocket engine to ignite and then shut
down after a liftoff from the launching pad of about two inches. The capsule events
were keyed to the engine shutdown after having been armed by stage liftoff, as this was
the normal procedure for sequencing unmanned flights. As you might expect, it was
very difficult to explain this spectacular series of events to the working press, and to
officials in Washington.
<br><br>
In those days an animal, in our case a chimpanzee, had to precede man into space.
The flight of the chimpanzee Ham was a major milestone in our program. Here again
we had some problems in the Redstone launch vehicle that resulted in a delayed pickup
of the spacecraft, and water entered the spacecraft as a result of landing damage to the
pressure shell. However, the animal performed admirably at zero gravity and was
picked up unharmed. Ham became quite famous and proved to be a really lovable
little fellow as well as a true pioneer.

Custom-made couches were provided for the

to the animals and instruments in the
spacecraft greatly reduced uncertainty about
the effects of severe g-loads an the body of
an astronaut. This medical research resulted
in the design of a couch for the Mercury capsule 
that would distribute the occupant's
weight and minimize acceleration loads on his
body.

All the things that were wrong with Ham's flight were corrected by hard work on
the ground without further flight tests. We were now ready for our first manned suborbital 
flight and I recommended to Dr. Dryden and Mr. Webb that we were ready to
go ahead. However, the Marshall Center required one more unmanned flight with the
Redstone for booster development. It was during this period that the Russians sent
Yuri Gagarin aloft in the Vostok spacecraft to become the first man in space.

A chimpanzee named Ham, shown hamming
it up in the photo below, was "a delightful
little fellow". The Mercury-Redstone 2 that
carried Ham into space January 31, 1961,
over-accelerated and ascended to a higher
altitude than planned. Nonetheless, the capsule 
was recovered with Ham in good shape.
He was then retired to a normal lifetime.
Mercury researchers, remembering Ham
fondly, occasionally visited him afterward.

<br><br>
All of these events were occurring at the time that President Kennedy and his staff
were taking over from the outgoing Eisenhower administration. Dr. Glennan, the Administrator 
of NASA during its first years, gave way to James Webb, who was to be the
Administrator until October 1968. With the change came other events. Project Mercury 
was examined by the new head of the President's Science Advisory Committee,
Dr. Jerome Wiesner, and a staff of medical and physical scientists. Our hearings before
the Wiesner Committee went reasonably well until we came to convincing the doctors
that it was safe for man to fly at zero gravity. Even though Ham, the chimpanzee, had
fared well and was completely normal after his flight, the medical men on the committee 
were reluctant to accept this evidence that man could stand even 15 minutes of zero
gravity. They were even concerned whether man could stand the mental stress of lying
on top of a rocket and being blasted into space. However, we were able to convince
Mr. Webb and Dr. Dryden that the program was sound, and they, in turn, convinced
the President and his staff. It was at this time that Ed Welsh, Executive Secretary of the
Space Council, remarked while Mr. Kennedy was pondering the impact of a failure,
"Mr. President, can the country stand a success?"
<br><br>
On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American to blast off from Cape
Canaveral in a flight that was to be of great importance to our future programs. His
flight in Freedoni 7 was followed by Gus Grissom in a Mercury capsule called Liberty
Bell 7. Orbital flights of the Mercury capsule followed with a mechanical man and a
chimpanzee named Enos. We were ready for manned flight into orbit. We were extremely 
fortunate to have six successful Atlas launch vehicles in a row to complete the
Mercury program. John Glenn's Mercury-Atlas mission on February 20, 1962, was
America's first orbital flight. We were to learn much from the flights of Glenn, 
Carpenter, Schirra, and Cooper that helped us in planning for the lunar program.
<br><br>
The exposure of man to zero gravity in these early manned flights was perhaps
among the greatest medical experiments of all time. All the Mercury astronauts found
the weightless state no particular problem. All returned to Earth with no medical difficulties 
whatever. This finding was so fundamental and straightforward that its importance 
was missed by many medical critics at the time. It now became simply a
question of how long man could withstand weightlessness, and detailed medical 
measurements were made to cast light on how the body compensated for the new 
environment. Zero gravity produced some problems in locomotion and habitability, 
but not in man himself. We believed that even the longest flights of the future would probably
require only methods of keeping the human body properly exercised and nourished in
order to prevent a different reaction on returning to the gravity of Earth.

  <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
  <h3>CHAPTER 2.3</h3>
  <hr><br>
</center>

<h3>THE YEAR OF DECISIONS (JUNE 1961 TO JUNE 1962)</h3>

The twelve months following the decision to go to the Moon saw the complete
plan unfold. New Centers were created, roles and missions were assigned, and the
basic designs for the launch vehicle and spacecraft were agreed upon. In addition, a
vital new program, called Gemini, was instituted to explore rendezvous, docking, and
the many other factors that were vital before Apollo could set out.
<br><br>

Tiny one-man spacecraft -then called capsules-
orbited the Earth in the Mercury program. 
They were checked out in a hangar at
Cape Canaveral before being hoisted up and
mated with a launch vehicle. Heat-resistant
shingles covered the afterbody.</table>
</center>

<br><br>
At the onset of the program, there were two government groups eager to participate. 
There was the Marshall Space Flight Center under Dr. Wernher von Braun,
which was a mature center having more than 5000 people, and there was the small
but expert Space Task Group of only a few hundred people, a group already severely
loaded with the Mercury project.  Mr. Webb, the Administrator, Dr. Dryden, the Deputy 
Administrator, and Dr. Seamans, the Associate Administrator, were the top management 
of the agency, and they brought onboard a young man named Brainerd
Holmes to head the manned spaceflight effort in Washington. This group lost little time
in deciding roles and missions for the lunar program. A new launch center was created
in Florida, and Dr. Kurt Debus, formerly of Marshall, was named its head. The Marshall 
Center got the job of developing the huge Moon rockets, although the size of the
rocket and the mode for going to the Moon had not yet been decided. The decision was
made to expand the Space Task Group into a full NASA Center and assign it the job
of developing the spacecraft and of creating a complex of technical facilities for 
spacecraft research and development, astronaut training, and flight operations. I became
head of this new NASA Center in Houston. The Center facilities were authorized by
Congress, but they did not yet exist. And so during the first year of Apollo the Space
Task Group became the Manned Spacecraft Center and moved from Virginia to Texas.
We occupied some 50-odd rented buildings while the new Center was being designed
and built. It was a period of growth, organization, and growing pains. We were establishing 
new contractor relations, moving families and acquiring new homes, as well as
conducting the orbital flights of Project Mcrcury.

<br><br>

Many of the key ideas and designs for going to the Moon were created during this
period of upheaval, turmoil, and the stress of major flight activities. Even before the
President's decision to land on the Moon, we had been working on designs and guidelines 
for a manned circumlunar mission. This was done in a series of bull sessions on
how we would design the spaceship for this purpose if the opportunity occurred. Our
key people would get together evenings, weekends, or whenever we could to discuss
such questions as crew size and other fundamental design factors. We believed that we
would need three men on the trip to do all the work required, even before the complexity 
of the landing was added. We believed that man would be able to stand a zero-gravity 
environment for the time required to go to the Moon and return. We had decided that 
an oxygen atmosphere of 5 pounds per square inch was the best engineering
compromise for a system that would permit extravehicular activity without another
module for an airlock. Other basic decisions included the selection of an onboard 
navigation system as well as the ground-based system, and controlled reentry to reduce
g-loads and give pinpoint landings. These original guidelines for lunar flight were 
presented to all NASA Centers and to the aerospace industry.
<br><br>

<center>
<table border=0 width=70%><tr><td>
<img src="i2-6c.jpg" ALT="A photo of an unsuccessful Mercury launch"> 
<td valign=bottom><font size=2>
Maximum public embarrassment in the Mercury program occurred in
the inadvertent "tower flight". A circuit quirk cut off the Redstone's
engines inches after liftoff. It was just enough to trigger the escape
sequence. The engineers could explain it, but the public inevitably 
wondered if we were really ready to send a man safely into space.
</table>
</center>

<br>

The conceptual design of the moonship was done in two phases. The command
and service module evolved first as part of our circumlunar studies, and the lunar
lander was added later after the mode decision was made. We were extremely fortunate
that the design that evolved had such intrinsic merit. We had designed our circumlunar
spaceship to have a command module containing the flight crew located on top of the
stack, so that the astronauts could escape by means of an escape tower if abort were
necessary during launch. The service module containing fuel for space propulsion, elec-
tric power equipment, and other stores, was underneath it with its big rocket and its
maneuvering systems. In the adapter below the service module, a third element of the
spacecraft was located: a mission module to which the crew would transfer for special
experiments. Thus when the full landing mission came along, we were able to substitute
the lunar lander for this mission module. The turnaround, docking, and tunnel transfers 
between the command module and the lunar module were then the same ones that
we had planned between the command module and the mission module.
<br><br>
The shape of the command module was a refinement of the Mercury capsule,
optimized for the higher heating rate and the angles of attack required for controlled
reentry. (One must remember that at this early time, reentry was still considered a
serious problem.) Reentry from the Moon would generate heating rates twice as great
as those in vehicles returning at orbital speed. Experts had warned us that shock-wave
radiation would be an additional source of heating. Our studies showed that the blunt
body was still the optimum shape, although the afterbody shape should be more highly
tapered than in the Mercury capsule. As it turned out, our flights to the Moon showed
that the Apollo design was very conservative, particularly on the afterbody, and the
margins of safety for the astronauts in returning from the Moon were comfortably
large. Max Faget, Caldwell Johnson, and others of the Manned Spacecraft Center were
largely responsible for putting down the original lines of the Apollo command module.
They also suggested the internal arrangement.

<br><br>
All during the early planning for the lunar missions, I had been greatly concerned
about the effects of solar radiation on the astronauts. Experts were not all in agreement
as to the amount of radiation that might be received on a mission to the Moon. I remember 
George Low stating that the normal shielding of the cabin walls, together with
the low probability of intense solar activity, would alleviate this hazard. He was right
and the radiation experienced by astronauts on trips to the Moon was of no medical
significance. Navigation in space might have been a serious problem had not Stark
Draper and his group at MIT gotten an early start. They were brought in under contract 
to devise a system for Apollo back in 1961. Working with their industrial partners, 
they produced a system that was amazingly accurate.
<br><br>
The pieces of the master plan were now beginning to fit together. In the fall of
1961, North American Aviation had won the contract for the Apollo command and
service module. The basic designs of the service propulsion engine, the reaction control
system, and the fuel cells were underway, but there were still major technical areas to
be settled. One of these was the launch-vehicle design. As a result of many studies, the
large rocket originally proposed had lost its backers. Dr. von Braun and the Huntsville
team were zeroing in on a rocket of intermediate size. This rocket was to use five of the
huge F-1 engines on the first stage and a new hydrogen-oxygen engine in the upper
stages. It could easily be sized to send more than 90,000 pounds on a course to the
Moon. We in Houston strongly supported this design, which was later called the Saturn
V. Only one rocket vehicle of this size would be required to send our spacecraft to the
Moon, if we used the lunar-orbit rendezvous technique. Getting official approval for
the lunar-orbit rendezvous was, however, to take considerable time and effort. Brainerd
Holmes, chosen by Webb to head Apollo in Washington, strongly favored Earth-orbit
rendezvous. This mode would use dual launchings of the huge Saturn V rockets, 
joining them together in orbit and pumping fuel from one to refill the other; and then 
realigning and lighting off that rocket to the Moon. In this way, much larger payloads
could be flown to the Moon than by a single rocket, but the technical and operational
problems seemed to me to be overwhelming.

John Glenn rounded the Earth three times
in Friendship 7, enjoyed his February 20,
1962, encounter with zero g, and wished his
capsule were glass so that he could see more.
Operations rnen on ground feared the heat
shield was not locked in place. Glenn, too,
had nervous moments and splashed his 
spacecraft into Atlantic 40 miles short of the 
projected area. Difficulties in controlling his
vehicle intensified engineers' drive for perfect
performances.</table>

minutes. He skinned his knuckles blowing the

had lost weight but doctors' exhaustive tests
showed no adverse effects from his 4-hour
22-minute flight. City after city feted Glenn,
and his capsule was put in the Smithsonian
Institution near the Wright brothers' airplane.</table>
</center>

<br><br>

In contrast, I believed in and supported lunar-orbit rendezvous. In this mode, the
lander leaves the mother ship in lunar orbit and goes down to the Moon's surface.
Upon returning to lunar orbit, it links up with the mother ship and the astronauts
transfer to the command module and return to Earth for reentry and landing. Lunar-orbit 
rendezvous was espoused by John Houbolt, chairman of the group that studied
this plan at the Langley Research Center. When I heard of this plan, I was convinced
that this was the way to go. It required far less weight injected toward the Moon, but
even more important, in my view, was the fact that one spacecraft could be designed
specifically for lunar landing and takeoff, while the other could be designed for flying
to and from the Moon and specifically for reentry and Earth landing. An additional
bonus was that it allowed the tremendous industrial job to be divided between two
major contractors since there would be two spacecraft, thereby giving each one a more
manageable task.
<br><br>
By the late fall of 1961, all of us at the new Manned Spacecraft Center were unified 
in support of lunar-orbit rendezvous and were working tooth and nail to find out
all we could about lunar landers, rendezvousing, and the tradeoffs to be made. In
December of 1961 we made an earnest appeal to Brainerd Holmes to approve Lunar-orbit 
rendezvous. He could not be convinced at that time, however, and only six
months later was the final decision made. Much of the credit for selling the lunar-orbit
mode must be given to the Houston people. Charles Frick, who was our Apollo Spacecraft 
Manager at that time, was particularly effective. Studies conducted by Frick's
people converted first the key engineers at the Marshall Space Flight Center, including
Drs. Rees and von Braun, and, finally, Brainerd Holmes. Dr. Joe Shea, Holmes' assistant, 
then carried the decision on to higher echelons of the Government. Mr. Webb
approved the lunar-orbit plan and only Dr. Wiesner and a few others of the President's
Science Advisors remained unconvinced. However, the White House accepted Mr.
Webb's decision.
<br><br>
We were extremely fortunate during this period to have Brainerd Holmes in
charge of the Apollo program. He encouraged the key center leaders to work together
by establishing a management council with regular meetings. During these meetings,
we argued out our different opinions and developed into a management team. A less
skillful leader might have forced an early arbitrary decision that would have made the
whole task of getting to the Moon virtually impossible.
<br><br>
Our Administrator, Mr. Webb, now had a master plan. It consisted of the giant
three-stage launch vehicle, the Saturn V. There would be a command module with
three astronauts onboard. The command module would be a blunt body, properly
shaped and ballasted for controlled gliding reentry. It would use ablative material for
the heat shield and would land at sea with parachutes. A separate service module
would carry the space-propulsion engine, attitude-control jets, the fuel cells for electric
power, together with supplies of fuel and oxygen. There would be a lunar-landing
stage designed specifically for the job of landing on the Moon. It would carry two men
down to the Moon's surface and back to rendezvous with the mother ship in orbit. In
simple terms, this was the technical plan for Apollo, and it was to need no change as it
went forward in development. All of this had been decided within one year after the
President's announcement. Less than six months later, Grumman had won the 
contract to build the lunar lander.
<br><br>
One major element of basic program planning was still missing. How were we to
bridge the tremendous gap between the simple Mercury Earth-orbital program and the
Apollo voyage to the Moon? We needed a chance to train our men in many new elements 
of spaceflight, and we needed an engineering prototype for our ideas as well.
The answer was Project Gemini.

<h3>GEMINI PROGRAM</h3>

The Gemini program was designed to investigate in actual flight many of the
critical situations which we would face later in the voyage of Apollo. The spacecraft
carried an onboard propulsion system for maneuvering in Earth orbit. A guidance and
navigation system and a rendezvous radar were provided to permit astronauts to try
out various techniques of rendezvous and docking with an Agena target vehicle. After
docking, the astronauts could light off the Agena rocket for large changes in orbit,
simulating the entry-into-lunar-orbit and the return-to-Earth burns of Apollo. Gemini
was the first to use the controlled reentry system that was required for Apollo in 
returning from the Moon. It had latches that could be opened and closed in space to
permit extravehicular activity by astronauts, and fuel cells similar in purpose to those
of Apollo to permit flights of long duration. The spacecraft was small by Apollo standards, 
carrying only two men in close quarters. However, the Titan II launch vehicle,
which was the best available at that time, could not manage a larger payload.

Early proposals for manned space vehicles varied
greatly in configuration and weight. In some, the men
within faced one way during launch and another during 
reentry; in others, the vehicle was turned around,
not the seats. Different approaches to the problem of
escape from launching disaster were shown in these
six industrial proposals. Environmental control,
thermal and radiation shielding, and protection
against meteorite impact were all unknowns facing
early spacecraft designers.

Group engineers, James A. Chamberlin and James T.
Ross, and here drawn by Harry A. Shoaf. It was seen
as part of a 35,000-pound payload that might be carried 
by a post-Mercury spacecraft. The other extreme
in early ideas to send men to the Moon called for a
direct-ascent manned lunar vehicle weighing some
150,000 pounds. It would have been launched by
Nova, a giant booster capable (on paper) of 
approximately 12 million pounds of thrust.
</table>

<br><br>
A total of 10 manned flights were made in the Gemini program between March
1965 and November 1966. They gave us nearly 2000 man-hours in space and developed 
the rendezvous and docking techniques essential to Apollo. By burning the Agena
rockets after docking, we were able to go to altitudes of more than 800 nautical miles
and prove the feasibility of the precise space maneuvers essential to Apollo. Our first
experience in EVA was obtained with Gemini and difficulties here early in the program
paved the way for the smoothly working EVA systems used later on the Moon. The
Borman and Lovell flight, Gemini VII, showed us that durations up to two weeks were
possible without serious medical problems, and the later flights showed the importance
of neutral buoyancy training in preparation of zero-gravity operations outside the
spacecraft.
<br><br>
Gemini gave us the confidence we needed in complex space operations, and it
was during this period that Chris Kraft and his team really made spaceflight operational. 
They devised superb techniques for flight management, and Mission Control
developed to where it was really ready for the complex Apollo missions. Chris Kraft,
Deke Slayton, head of the astronauts, and Dr. Berry, our head of Medical Operations,
learned to work together as a team. Finally, the success of these operations and the
high spaceflight activity kept public interest at a peak, giving our national leaders the
broad supporting interest and general approval that made it possible to press ahead
with a program of the scale of Apollo.

the Cape, was to climb to a record altitude
of 853 miles in September 1966. It docked
in space with an Agena, and then used the
big Agena rocket for the energy needed
to reach the larger orbit. Gemini flights
provided priceless experience in the tricky
business of rendezvousing two craft in
space with the minimum expenditure of
energy. They also supplied practice at
docking and in extravehicular activity,
both needed for future Moon voyages.
Finally, they helped build up experience
with the mission-control system developing
on the ground to support manned spaceflight.

<h3>THE PLAN IN RETROSPECT</h3>

In thinking back over the flights of Apollo, I am impressed at the intrinsic excellence 
of the plan that had evolved. I have, of course, somewhat oversimplified its evolution, 
and there were times when we became discouraced, and when it seemed that the
sheer scope of the task would overwhelm us in some areas there were surprises and other
areas proceeded quite naturally and smoothly.

<br><br>

<table border=0 width=70%><tr><td>

Gemini launches drew hundreds of thousands of
spectators, awed by the roar, flame, and smoke of

and camped by roadsides. Millions of others
watched launchings an television, and the astronauts
received tumultuous welcomes on their return. The

Cooper and Conrad for 120 revolutions of the Earth
during August 1965. Fuel cells had their first space

feet, was flown by astronauts Borman and Lovell in
a flight lasting more than 330 hours. Rendezvous
proved entirely feasible but tricky to manage with
minimum fuel use.

The most cruel surprise in the program was the loss of three astronauts in the
Apollo fire, which occurred before our first manned flight. It was difficult for the country 
to understand how this could have occurred, and it seemed for a time that the program 
might not survive. I believe that the self-imposed discipline that resulted, and the
ever-greater efforts on quality, enhanced our chances for success, coming as they did
while the spacecraft was being rebuilt and final plans formulated.
<br><br>
The pogo problem was another surprise. Like the fire, it showed how dif'ficult
it was to conquer this new ocean of space. Fortunately, intensive and brilliant work
with the big Saturns solved the problem with the launch rocket, permitting the flights to
proceed without mishap.

We had planned a buildup of our flights, starting with a simple Earth-orbit flight
of the command and service modules (Apollo 7), to be followed by similar trials with
the lunar module (LM) added, for tests of rendezvous and docking and various burns
of the LM engines (Apollo 9). These tests would have then been followed by flights
to Lunar orbit with the LM scouting the landing but not going all the way in (Apollo
10), and then the landing (Apollo 11).
<br><br>
After Apollo 7, however, the LM was not yet ready and the opportunity occurred
to fly to the Moon with command and service module (CSM) only. This flight (Apollo 8) 
was to give us many benefits early in the progam. Technically, it gave us information 
on our communication and tracking equipment for later missions, a close view of
our landing sites, and experience in cislunar space with a simplified mission. Politically,
it may have assured us of being first to the Moon, since the stepped-up schedule 
precluded the Russians from flying a man around the Moon with their Zond before we
reached the Moon following our previously scheduled missions.
<br><br>
The flights came off almost routinely following Apollo 8 on through the first lunar
landing and the flight to the Surveyor crater. But Apollo 13 was to see our first major
inflight emergency when an explosion in the service module cut off the oxygen supply
to the command module. Fortunately, the LM was docked to the CSM, and its oxygen
and electric power, as well as its propulsion rocket, were available. During the 4-day
ordeal of Apollo 13, the world watched breathlessly while the LM pushed the stricken
command module around the Moon and back to Earth. Precarious though it was,
Apollo 13 showed the merit of having separate spacecraft modules, and of training of
flight and gound crews to adapt to emergency. The ability of the flight directors on the
ground to read out the status of flight equipment, and the training of astronauts to meet
emergencies, paid off on this mission.
<br><br>
Apollo surely is a prototype for explorations of the future when we again send
men into space to build a base on the Moon or to explore even farther away from Earth.

By dawn's first light, a giant Apollo/Saturn V aboard 
its mobile launcher trundles toward ist rendezvous with 
the Moon. Riding its crawler past spaceport marshes, 
the rocket moves at about one mph. (During its voyage 
in space, a part of it containing men will travel at 24,300 mph.)
Nothing of the size and power of this formidable creation 
had ever been built before.

<br><br>
With the beep-beep-beep of Sputnik on October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union
had inaugurated the Space Age. It had also presented American planners with the painful 
realization that there was no launch vehicle in the U.S. stable capable of orbiting
anything approaching Sputnik's weight.
<br><br>
Responding to a proposal submitted by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, the
Department of Defense was in just the right mood to authorize ABMA to develop a
1,500,000-pound-thrust booster. That unprecedented thrust was to be generated by
clustering eight S-3D Rocketdyne engines used in the Jupiter and Thor missiles. The
tankage for the kerosene and liquid oxygen was also to be clustered to make best use of
tools and fixtures availabie from the Redstone and Jupiter programs. The program was
named "Saturn" simply because Saturn was the next outer planet after Jupiter in the
solar system.
<br><br>
Gen. John B. Medaris, commander of ABMA and my boss, felt that for a good
design job on the booster it was necessary for us also to study suitable upper stages for
the Saturn. On November 18, 1959, Saturn was transferred to the new National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration. NASA promptly appointed a committee to settle
the upper-stage selection for Saturn. It was chaired by Dr. Abe Silverstein who, as associate 
director of NASA's Lewis Center in Cleveland, had spent years exploring liquid
hydrogen as a rocket fuel. As a result of this work the Air Force had let a contract with
Pratt & Whitney for the development of a small 15,000-pound-thrust liquid hydrogen/liquid 
oxygen engine, two of which were to power a new "Centaur" top stage for the
Air Force's Atlas. Abe was on solid ground when he succeeded in persuading his committee 
to swallow its scruples about the risks of the new fuel and go to high-power
liquid hydrogen for the upper stage of Saturn.
<br><br>
In the wake of Gagarin's first orbital flight on April 12, 1961, Saturn gained
increased importance. Nevertheless, when the first static test of the booster with all eight
engines was about to begin, at least one skeptical witness predicted a tragic ending of
"Cluster's last stand". Doubts about the feasibility of clustering eight highly complex
engines had indeed motivated funding for two new engine developments. One was in
essence an uprating and simplification effort on the S-3D, and it led to the 
188,000-pound-thrust H-1 engine. The other aimed at a very powerful new engine called F-1,
which was to produce a full 1.5-million-pound thrust in a single barrel. Both contracts
went to Rocketdyne.
<br><br>
Following up on the recommendation of the Silverstein committee, NASA
awarded a contract to the Douglas Aircraft Company for the development of a second
stage for Saturn that became known as S-IV. It was to be powered by six Centaur engines. 
On September 8, 1960, President Eisenhower came to Huntsville to dedicate the
new Center, named after Gen. Georce C. Marshall. It was to become the focal point for
NASA's new large launch vehicles, and I was appointed as its first director.

<h3>DETERMINING SATURN'S CONFIGURATION</h3>

The first launch of the Saturn booster was still five months away when, on May 25,
1961, President John F. Kennedy proposed that the United States commit itself to land
a man on the Moon "in this decade". For this ambitious task a launch vehicle far more
powerful than our eight-engine Saturn would be needed. To determine its exact power
requirements, a selection had to be made from among three operational concepts for a
manned voyage to the Moon: direct ascent, Earth orbit rendezvous (EOR), and lunar
orbit rendezvous (LOR).

<br><br><br>
<center>
<table border=0 width=70%><tr><td>

Dr. von Braun, standing
next to one of the five engines at the after end of the
Saturn V vehicle's first stage
(on display at the Alabama
Space Museum), provides a
scale reference for the humain figures shown alongside two of the rockets in
the drawing below. The sequence of launch vehicles
of ever-increasing size and
power that led from the 46-foot-high V-2 rocket through
the Mercury and Gemini
boosters to the 363-foot
Saturn V is drawn here at a single scale.

<img src="i3-2b.jpg" ALT="A picture of 8 rockets"> 
</table>
</center>
<br>

With direct ascent, the entire spacecraft would soft-land on the Moon carrying
enough propellants to fly back to Earth. Weight and performance studies showed that
this would require a launch vehicle of a lift-off thrust of 12 million pounds, furnished by
eight F-1 engines. We called this hypothetical launch vehicle Nova. The EOR mode
envisioned two somewhat smaller rockets that were to rendezvous in Earth orbit where
their payloads would be combined. In the LOR mode a single rocket would launch a
payload consisting of a separable spacecraft toward the Moon, where an onboard propulsion 
unit would ease it into orbit. A two-stage lunar module (LM) would then
detach itself from the orbiting section and descend to the lunar surface. Its upper stage
would return to the circumlunar orbit for rendezvous with the orbiting section. In a
second burst of power, the propulsion unit would finally drive the reentry element with
its crew out of lunar orbit and back to Earth.
<br><br>

As all the world knows, the LOR mode was ultimately selected. But even after its
adoption, the number of F-1 engines to be used in the first stage of the Moon rocket
remained unresolved for quite a while. H.H. Koelle, who ran our Project Planning
Group at Marshall, had worked out detailed studies of a configuration called Saturn IV
with four F-l's, and another called Saturn V with five F-l's in its first stage. Uncertainty 
about LM weight and about propulsion performance of the still untested F-1
and upper-stage engines, combined with a desire to leave a margin for growth, finally
led us to the choice of the Saturn V configuration.
<br>

<table border=0 width=70% align=right cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><img src="i3-2c.jpg" ALT="A picture of the cross-section of Saturn V">
<td valign=bottom><font size=2>
The stack: the three-stage launch vehicle, Saturn V,
surmounted by its payload, the Apollo spacecraft.
The greater part of the launch vehicle consists of
tankage for the fuel and for the oxidant, LOX
(liquid oxygen), used in all three Saturn V stages.
The powerful F-1 engines of the first stage burn
kerosene to produce a combined thrust of 7.5
million pounds. The fuel for the J-2 engines of the
two upper stages is liquid hydrogen. The combined
thrust of the second stage's five engines is just over
a million pounds, or five times that of the third
stage's single J-2 engine. Development of the original 
hydrogen tanks was difficult because the low
boiling point of hydrogen (-253 C) required insulation 
sufficient to prevent transfer of heat from
the outside and the comparatively warm (-183 C) liquid oxygen.
</table>

Despite the higher power offered by liquid hydrogen, Koelle's studies indicated
that little would be gained by using it in the first stage also, where it would have needed
disproportionately large tanks. (Liquid hydrogen is only one twelfth as dense as kerosene, 
so a much larger tank volume would have been required.) In all multistage rockets
the upper stages are lighter than the lower ones. Thus heavier but less energetic kerosene 
in the first stage, in combination with lighter but more powerful hydrogen in the
upper stages, made possible a better launch-vehicle configuration.
<br><br>
Saturn V, as it emerged from the studies, would consist of three stages-all brand
new. The first one, burning kerosene and oxygen, would be powered by five F-1 engines. 
We called it S-IC. The second stage, S-11, would need about a million pounds of
thrust and, if also powered by five engines, would call for the development of new
200,000-pound hydrogen-oxygen engines. A single engine of this thrust would just be
right to power the third stage. The Saturn l's S-IV second stage was clearly not powerful
enough to serve as the Saturn's third one. A much larger tankage and at least thirteen
of Pratt & Whitney's little LR-10 engines would be required; this did not appear very
attractive.
<br><br>
When bids for the new J-2 engine were solicited, Pratt & Whitney with its ample
liquid-hydrogen experience was a strong contender. But when all the points in the
sternly controlled bidding procedure were counted, North American's Rocketdyne 
Division won again.
<br><br>
North American had been involved in the development of liquid fuel rocket engines 
since the immediate postwar years and the Navajo long range ramjet program.
The engines it developed for the Navajo booster and their offspring later found their
way into the Atlas, Redstone, Thor, and Jupiter programs. For the testing of these
engines NAA's Rocketdyne Division had acquired a boulder-strewn area high in the
Santa Susana mountains, north of Los Angeles, that had previously served as rugged
background for many a Western movie. The Santa Susana facility would henceforth
serve not only for the development of the new J-2 engine, but also for short duration
"battleship" testing of the five-engine cluster of these engines powering the S-11 stage.
(Safety and noise considerations ruled out the use of Santa Susana for the 
1.5-million-pound-thrust F-1 engine. Test stands for its development were therefore set up in the
Mojave desert, adjacent to Edwards Air Force Base.)

<h3>CHOOSING THE BUILDERS</h3>

How many prime contractors, we wondered, should NASA bring in for the development 
of the Saturn V? Just one, or one per stage? How about the Instrument Unit
that was to house the rocket's inertial-guidance system, its digital computer, and an
assortment of radio command and telemetry functions? Who would do the overall
systems engineering and monitor the intricate interface between the huge rocket and
the complex propellant-loading and launching facilities at Cape Canaveral? Where
would the various stages be static-tested?

<br>

Understandably, the entire aerospace industry was attracted by both the financial
value and the technological challenge of Saturn V. To give the entire plum to a single
contractor would have left all others unhappy. More important, Saturn V needed the
very best engineering and management talent the industry could muster. By breaking
up the parcel into several pieces, more top people could be brought to bear on the
program.

The Boeing Company was the successful bidder on the first stage (S-IC); North
American Aviation won the second stage (S-11), and Douclas Aircraft fell heir to the
Saturn V's third stage (S-IVB). Systems engineering and overall responsibility for the
Saturn V development was assigned to the Marshall Space Flight Center. The 
inertial-guidance system had emerged from a Marshall in-house development, and as it had to
be located close to other elements of the big rocket's central nervous system, it was only
logical to develop the Instrument Unit (IU) to house this electronic gear as a Marshall
in-house project. IU flight units were subsequently produced by IBM, which had
developed the launch-vehicle computer.

three flight S-IC stages were assembled at MSFC and tested in this stand. The massively reinforced 
construction of the 300-foot-tall stand was essential to withstand the 7.5 million pounds
of thrust developed by the stage's engines during static testing.

<br><br>

Uniquely tight procurement procedures introduced by NASA Administrator Jim
Webb made it possible to acquire billions of dollars' worth of exotic hardware and
facilities without overrunning initial cost estimates and without the slightest hint of
procurement irregularity. Before it could issue a request for bids, the contracting NASA
Center had to prepare a detailed procurement plan that required the Administrator's
personal approval, and that could not be changed thereafter. It had to include a point-scoring 
system in which evaluation criteria - technical merits, cost, skill availability,
prior experience, etc. - were given specific weighting factors. Business and technical
criteria were evaluated by separate teams not permitted to know the other's rankings.
The total matrix was then assembled by a Source Evaluation Board that gave a complete 
presentation of all bids and their scoring results to the three top men in the agency,
who themselves chose the winner. There was simply no room for arbitrariness or 
irregularity in such a system.

The "pogo problem," a lengthwise
mode of vibration recognized in the
second Saturn V launch, was speedily
solved through mathematical analysis
supported by data collected in shake
tests. To supplement shake tests in
Marshall's Dynamic Test Tower, Boeing 
quickly erected this tower for
special pressure tests at the Michoud
Assembly Facility.
</table>

<br>

The tremendous increase in contracts needed for the Saturn V program required
a reorganization of the Marshall Space Flight Center. Most of our resources had been
spent in-house, and our contracts had either been let to support contractors or to producers 
of our developed products. Now 90 percent of our budget was spent in industry,
much of it on complicated assignments which included design, manufacture, and
testing. So on September 1, 1963, I announced that Marshall would henceforth consist
of two major elements, one to be called Research and Development Operations, the
other Industrial Operations. Most of my old R&D associates then became a sort of
architect's staff keeping an eye on the integrity of the structure called Saturn V, and the
other group funded and supervised the industrial contractors.

That same year Dr. George Mueller had taken over as NASA's Associate Administrator 
for Manned Space Flight. He brought with him Air Force Maj. Gen. Samuel
Phillips, who had served as program manager for Minuteman, and now became Apollo
Program Director at NASA Headquarters. Both men successfully shaped the three
NASA Centers involved in the lunar-landing program into a team. I was particularly
fortunate in that Sam Phillips persuaded his old friend and associate Col. (later Maj.
Gen.) Edwin O'Connor to assume the directorship of Marshall's Industrial Operations.
On September 7, 1961, NASA had taken over the Michoud Ordnance plant at
New Orleans. The cavernous plant - 46 acres under one roof - was assigned to 
Chrysler and Boeing to set up production for the first stages of Saturn I and Saturn V. In
October 1961 an area of 13,350 acres in Hancock County, Miss., was acquired. Huge
test stands were erected there for the static testing, of Saturn V's first and second stages.

Shipment of the oversize stages between Huntsville, Michoud, the Mississippi Test
Facility, the two California contractors, and the Kennedy Space Center in Florida
required barges and seagoing ships. Soon Marshall found itself running a small fleet
that included the barges <i>Palaemon</i>, <i>Orion</i>, and <i>Promise</i>. 
For shipments through the
Panama Canal we used the USNS <i>Point Barrow</i> and the SS <i>Steel Executive</i>. 
For rapid transport we had two converted Stratocruisers at our disposal with the descriptive
names "Pregnant Guppy" and "Super Guppy". Their bulbous bodies could accommodate 
cargo up to the size of an S-IVB stage.

 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
 <h3>CHAPTER 3.4</h3>
 <hr><br>
</center>

<h3>AN ALL-UP TEST FOR THE FIRST FLIGHT</h3>

In 1964 George Mueller visited Marshall and casually introduced us to his
philosophy of "all-up" testing. To the conservative breed of old rocketeers who had
learned the hard way that it never seemed to pay to introduce more than one major
change between flight tests, George's ideas had an unrealistic ring. Instead of beginning 
with a ballasted first-stage flight as in the Saturn I program, adding a live second
stage only after the first stage had proven its flightworthiness, his "all-up" concept was
startling. It meant nothing less than that the very first flight would be conducted with
all three live stages of the giant Saturn V. Moreover, in order to maximize the payoff
of that first flight, George said it should carry a live Apollo command and service
module as payload. The entire flight should be carried through a sophisticated trajectory 
that would permit the command module to reenter the atmosphere under conditions 
simulating a return from the Moon.
<br><br>
It sounded reckless, but George Mueller's reasoning was impeccable. Water
ballast in lieu of a second and third stage would require much less tank volume than
liquid-hydrogen-fueled stages, so that a rocket tested with only a live first stage would
be much shorter than the final configuration. Its aerodynamic shape and its body
dynamics would thus not be representative. Filling the ballast tanks with liquid hydrogen? 
Fine, but then why not burn it as a bonus experiment? And so the arguments
went on until George in the end prevailed.
<br><br>
In retrospect it is clear that without all-up testing the first manned lunar landing
could not have taken place as early as 1969. Before Mueller joined the program, it had
been decided that a total of about 20 sets of Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V rockets
would be needed. Clearly, at least ten unmanned flights with the huge new rocket would
be required before anyone would muster the courage to launch a crew with it. (Even
ten would be a far smaller number than the unmanned launches of Redstones, Atlases,
and Titans that had preceded the first manned Mercury and Gemini flights.) The first
manned Apollo flights would be limited to low Earth orbits. Gradually we would inch
our way closer to the Moon, and flight no. 17, perhaps, would bring the first lunar
landing. That would give us a reserve of three flights, just in case things did not work
as planned.

Mueller changed all this, and his bold telescoping of the overall plan bore
magnificent fruit: With the third Saturn V ever to be launched, Frank Borman's
Apollo 8 crew orbited the Moon on Christmas 1968, and the sixth Saturn V carried
Neil Armstrong's Apollo 11 to the first lunar landing. Even though production was
whittled back to fifteen units, Saturn V's launched a total of two unmanned and ten
manned Apollo missions, plus one Skylab space station. Two uncommitted rockets
went into mothballs.

</center>
<br><br>

But let us go back to 1962. To develop and manufacture the large S-11 and S-IVB
stages, two West Coast contractors required special facilities. A new Government plant
was built at Seal Beach where North American was to build the S-11. S-IVB development 
and manufacture was moved into a new Douglas center at Huntington Beach,
while static testing went to Sacramento. The Marshall Center in Huntsville was also
substantially enlarged. A huge new shop building was erected for assembly of the first
three S-IC stages. A large stand was built to static-test the huge stage under the full
7,500,000-pound-thrust of its five F-1 engines. These engines generated no less than
180 million horsepower. As about 1 percent of that energy was converted into noise,
neighborhood windows could be expected to break and plaster rain from ceilings if the
wind was blowing from the wrong direction or the clouds were hanging low. A careful
meteorological monitoring program had to be instituted to permit test runs only under
favorable weather conditions.
<br><br>
Although the most visible and audible signs of Marshall's involvement in Saturn V
development were the monstrous and noisy S-IC engines, equally important work was
done in its Astrionics Laboratory. The Saturn V's airbearing-supported inertial guidance 
platform was born there, along with a host of other highly sophisticated electronic
devices. In the Astrionics Simulator Facility, guidance and control aspects of a complete 
three-stage flight of the great rocket could be electronically simulated under all
sorts of operating conditions. The supersonic passage of the rocket through a 
high-altitude jet stream could be duplicated, for instance, or the sudden failure of one of 
the S-11 stage's five engines. The simulator would faithfully display the excursions of the 
swivel-mounted rocket engines in response to external wind forces or unsymmetrical loss of
thrust, establishing the dynamic response of the entire rocket and the resulting 
structural loads.

Super Guppy, bigger sister of the aptly named Pregnant Guppy, was the only airplane in
the world capable of carrying a complete S-IVB stage. Both aircraft were built by John M.
Conroy, who started with the fuselages of two surplus Boeing C-97 Stratocruisers, ballooned out
the upper decks enormously, and hinged the front sections so that they could be folded back
110 degrees. Super Guppy flew smoothly at a 250-mph cruising speed, and its cargo deck 
provided a 25-foot clear diameter. Below, a finished S-IVB stage is being unloaded onto a cargo

The Saturn V's own guidance system would guide the Apollo flights not only to an
interim parking orbit but all the way to translunar injection. It fed position data to the
onboard digital computer, which in turn prepared and sent control signals to the 
hydraulic actuators that swiveled the big engines for flight-path control. As propellant
consumption lightened the rocket, and as it traversed the atmosphere at subsonic and
supersonic speeds, the gain settings of these control signals had to vary continuously,
for proper control damping. Serving as the core of the Saturn V's central nervous system, 
the computer did many other things too. It served in the computerized prelaunch
checkout procedure of the great rocket, helped calibrate the telemetry transmissions,
activated staging procedures, turned equipment on and off as the flight proceeded
through various speed regimes, and even watched over the cooling system that stabilized
the temperatures of the array of sensitive blackboxes within the IU. So although the
working flight lifetime of the Saturn computer was measured in minutes, it performed
many exacting duties during its short and busy life.

wasn't easy to back into its barge at Huntsville. Below, a rocket-laden 
barge is escorted by two tugs through Sun-bronzed waters.

<br>

In planning the lunar mission, why did we plan to stop over in a parking orbit?
The reason was twofold: For one, in case of a malfunction it is much easier and safer
for astronauts to return from Earth orbit than from a high-speed trajectory carrying
them toward the Moon. A parking orbit offers both crew and ground controllers an
opportunity to give the vehicle a thorough once-over before committing it to the long
voyage. Second, there is the consideration of operational flexibility. lf the launch came
off at precisely the right instant, only one trajectory from the launch pad to the Moon
had to be considered. But as there was always the possibility of a last-minute delay it
appeared highly desirable to provide a launch window of reasonable duration. This
meant not only that the launch azimuth hand to be changed, but due to Earth rotation
and to orbital motion the Moon would move to a different position in the sky. A parking 
orbit permitted an ideal way to take up the slack: the longer a launch delay, the
shorter the stay in the parking orbit. Restart of the third stage in parking orbit for
translunar injection would take place at almost the same time of day regardless of
launch delays. (As it happened, all but two of the manned Apollo-Saturns lifted off
within tiny fractions of a second of being precisely on time. One was held for weather
and the other was held because of a faulty diode in the ground-support equipment.)
<br><br>
Why was the big rocket so reliable? Saturn V was not overdesigned in the sense
that everything was made needlessly strong and heavy. But great care was devoted to
identifying the real environment in which each part was to work - and "environment"
included accelerations, vibrations, stresses, fatigue loads, pressures, temperatures, 
humidity, corrosion, and test cycles prior to launch. Test programs were then conducted
against somewhat more severe conditions than were expected. A methodology was
created to assess each part with a demonstrated reliability figure, such as 0.9999998.
Total rocket reliability would then be the product of all these parts reliabilities, and had
to remain above the figure of 0.990, or 99 percent. Redundant parts were used whenever 
necessary to attain this reliability goal.
<br><br>
Marshall built an overall systems simulator on which all major subsystems
of the three-stage rocket could be exercised together. This facility featured replicas of
propellant tanks that could be loaded or unloaded, pressurized or vented, and that duplicated 
the pneumatic and hydraulic dynamics involved. Electrically, it simulated the
complete network of the launch vehicle and its interfacing ground support equipment.

<h3>THE PERILS OF POGO</h3>

An important Marshall facility was the Dynamic Test Tower, the only place outside 
the Cape where the entire Saturn V vehicle could be assembled. Electrically
powered shakers induced various vibrational modes in the vehicle, so that its elastic
deformations and structural damping characteristics could be determined. The Dynamic 
Test Tower played a vital role in the speedy remedy of a problem that unexpectedly 
struck in the second flight of a Saturn V. Telemetry indicated that during the
powered phases of all three stages a longitudinal vibration occurred, under which the
rocket alternately contracted and expanded like a concertina. This "pogo" oscillation
(the name derived from the child's toy) would be felt particularly strongly in the command 
module.
<br><br>
Analysis, supported by data collected in engine tests, confirmed that the oscillation 
was caused by resonance coupling between the springlike elastic structure of the
tankage, and the rocket engines' propellant-feed systems. Susceptibility to pogo (a 
phenomenon not unknown to missile designers) had been thoroughly investigated by the
Saturn stage contractors, who had certified that their respective designs would be 
pogo-free. It turned out that these mathematical analyses had been conducted on an 
inadequate data base.
<br><br>
Once the problem was understood, a fix was quickly found. "ln sync" with the
pogo oscillations, pressures in the fuel and oxidizer feed lines fluctuated wildly. lf these
fluctuations could be damped by gas-filled cavities attached to the propellant lines,
which would act as shock absorbers, the unacceptable oscillation excursions should be
drastically reduced. Such cavities were readily available in the liquid-oxygen prevalves,
whose back sides were now filled with pressurized helium gas tapped off the high-pressure 
control system. After a few weeks of hectic activity, a pogo-free Saturn flight no.
3 successfully boosted the Apollo 8 crew to their Christmas flight in lunar orbit.

<h3>ARTIFICIAL STORMS AT THE ARM FARM</h3>

The connections between the ground and the towering space vehicle posed a tricky
problem. An umbilical tower, even higher than the vehicle itself, was required to 
support an array of swingarms that at various levels would carry the cables and the 
pneumatic, fueling, and venting lines to the rocket stages and to the spacecraft. The 
swingarms had to be in place during final countdown, but in the last moments they had to be
turned out of the way to permit the rocket to rise. There was always the possibility,
however, of some trouble after the swingarms had been disconnected. For instance, the
holddown mechanism would release the rocket only after all five engines of the first
stage produced full power. lf this condition was not attained within a few seconds, all
engines would shut down. In such a situation, unless special provisions were made for
reattachment of some swingarms, Launch Control would be unable to "safe" the vehicle
and remove the flight crew from its precarious perch atop a potential bomb.
<br><br>
These considerations led to the establishment, at Marshall, of a special Swingarm
Test Facility, where detachment and reconnection of various arms was tested under
brutally realistic conditions. On the "Arm Farm" extreme conditions (such as a launch
scrub during an approaching Florida thunderstorm) could be simulated. Artificial rain
was blown by aircraft propellers against the swingarms and their interconnect plugs,
while the vehicle portion was moved back and forth, left and right, simulating the swaying 
motions that the towering rocket would display during a storm.
<br><br>
Throughout Saturn V's operational life, its developers felt a relentless pressure to
increase its payload capability. At first, the continually growing weight of the LM 
(resulting mainly from additional operational features and redundancy) was the prime
reason. Later, after the first successful lunar landing, the appetite for longer lunar stay
times grew. Scientists wanted landing sites at higher lunar latitudes, and astronauts
like tourists everywhere wanted a rental car at their destination. How well this growth
demand was met is shown by a pair of numbers: The Saturn V that carried Apollo 8
to the Moon had a total payload above the IU of Iess than 80.000 pounds; in 
comparison, the Saturn that launched the last lunar mission, Apollo 17, had a payload of
116,000 pounds.

Silhouetted by the glare of the first Saturn V launch, a flock of
birds calmly conducts its dawn patrol of the lagoon. As the vehicle
begins to clear the launch pad, several more seconds will pass before 
the crashing roar reaches the flock. This is Apollo 4, the first
"all up" test of the launch vehicle and spacecraft, proving out their
flight compatibility in an unmanned Earth-orbiting mission.

On April 3, 1967, NASA 2, a Grumman Gulfstream, was taxiing for takeoff
at Washington National Airport. Bob Gilruth, Director of NASA's Manned 
Spacecraft Center and I (his Deputy at that time) were about to return to 
Houston after a series of meetings in Washington. But just before starting 
down the runway, the pilot received a cryptic message from the tower: return 
to the terminal and ask the passengers to wait in the pilot's lounge. 
Soon arrived Administrator Jim Webb, his Deputy Bob Seamans, George Mueller, 
the head of Manned Space Flight, and Apollo Program Director Sam Phillips.
Counting Bob Gilruth, everybody in the NASA hierarchy between me and the 
President was there.

<br><br>
Jim Webb, using fewer words than usual, came right to the point: Apollo was
faltering; the catastrophic fire on January 27 that had taken the lives of 
three astronauts had been a major setback. All its consequences were not yet known; 
time was running out on the Nation's commitment to land on the Moon before the 
end of the decade.
Then the punch line: NASA wanted me to take on the task of rebuilding the Apollo
spacecraft, and to see to it that we met the commitment.
<br><br>
Thus began the most exciting, most demanding, sometimes most frustrating, and
always most challenging 27 months in my career as an engineer. Not that Apollo was
completely new to me. Six years earlier I had chaired the NASA committee that recommended 
a manned lunar landing and provided the background work for President
Kennedy's decision to go to the Moon. In the intervening years I had not been involved
in the day-to-day engineering details of the Apollo spaceships - yet 27 months later,
sitting at a console in the Launch Control Center during the final seconds of the countdown 
for Apollo 11, I had come to know and understand two of the most complex
flying machines ever built by man.

<h3>TWO MAGNIFICENT FLYING MACHINES</h3>

But in April 1967 these machines were essentially strangers to me. How were they
designed? How were they built and tested? What were their strengths and their weaknesses? 
Above all, what flaw in their design had caused the fire, and what other flaws
lurked in their complexity?
<br><br>
First there was the command and service module -the CSM- collectively a single
spacecraft, but separable into two components (the command module and the service
module) for the final minutes of reentry. It was built by North American Rockwell
in Downey, California, a place which would become one of my many "homes" for the
next 27 months. The command module was compact, solid, and sturdy, designed with
one overriding consideration: to survive the fiery heat of reentry as it abandoned the
service module and slammed back into the atmosphere at the tremendous speed of
25,000 miles an hour. It was a descendant of Mercury and Gemini, but its task was
much more difficult. The speed of reentry from the Moon is nearly one and one-half
times as fast as returning from Earth orbit; to slow down from that speed required the
dissipation of great amounts of energy. In fact, there is enough energy at reentry to
melt and vaporize all the material in the command module several times over, so the
spacecraft had to be protected by an ablative heat shield that charred and slowly
burned away, thereby protecting all that it surrounded. The command module was
also crammed with equipment and subsystems; and of course three men lived in it for
most of the lunar journey, and one of them for all of it. It was cone-shaped, with a blunt
face for reentry; it was 11 feet long, 13 feet in diameter, and weighed 6 tons.
<br><br>
The service module was the quartermaster of the pair. It carried most of the stores
needed for the journey through space; oxygen, power-generation equipment, and water
as a byproduct of power generation. More than that, it had a propulsion system bigger
and more powerful than many upper stages of present launch vehicles. It made all the
maneuvers needed to navigate to the Moon, to push itself and the lunar module into
lunar orbit, and to eject itself out of orbit to return to Earth. The service module was
a cylinder 13 feet in diameter and 24 feet long. Fully loaded it weighed 26 tons.
<br><br>
Then there was the lunar module (LM, pronounced LEM, which had actually
been its designation - for lunar excursion module - until someone decided that the
word "excursion" might lend a frivolous note to Apollo). LM was the first true spaceship; 
it was hidden in a cocoon during the launch through the atmosphere because it
could operate only in the vacuum of space. Built by Grumman in Bethpage, New York
(another of my many homes away from home), it was somewhat flimsy, with paper-thin 
walls and spindly legs. Its mission was to carry two explorers from lunar orbit to
the surface of the Moon, provide a base for them on the Moon, and then send its upper
half back into lunar orbit to a rendezvous with its mother ship, the CSM. Designed by
aeronautical engineers who for once did not have to worry about airflow and streamlining, 
it looked like a spider, a gargantuan, other-world insect that stood 23 feet tall
and weighed 16 tons. When Jim McDivitt returned from Apollo 91, LM's first rnanned
flight, he gave me a photograph of his <i>Spider</i> in space, with this caption: "Many
thanks for the funny-looking spacecraft. It sure flies better than it looks."
<br><br>
These were the Apollo spacecraft: two machines. 17 tons of aluminum, steel,
copper, titanium, and synthetic materials; 33 tons of propellant; 4 million parts, 40
miles of wire, 100,000 drawings, 26 subsystems, 678 switches, 410 circuit breakers.
<br><br>
To look after them there was a brand-new program manager who would have to
leap upon this fast-moving train, learn all about it, decide what was good enough
and what wasn't, what to accept, and what to change. In the meanwhile, the clock
ticked away, bringing the end of the decade ever closer.

 <h3>CHAPTER 4.3</h3>

<h3>COMPLEX SUBSYSTEMS PERFORMED VITAL FUNCTIONS</h3>

At the heart of each spacecraft were its subsystems. "Subsystem" is space-age
jargon for a mechanical or electronic device that performs a specific function such as
providing oxygen, electric power, and even bathroom facilities. CSM and LM subsystems 
performed similar functions, but differed in their design because each had to
be adapted to the peculiarities of the spacecraft and its environment.
<br><br>
Begin with the environmental control system - the life-support system for man
and his machine. It was a marvel of efficiency and reliability, with weight and volume
at a premium. A scuba diver uses a tank of air in 60 minutes; in Apollo an equivalent
amount of oxygen lasted 15 hours. Oxygen was not simply inhaled once and then 
discarded: the exhaled gas was scrubbed to eliminate its CO<sub>2</sub> recycled, and reused. 
At the same time, its temperature was maintained at a comfortable level, moisture was
removed, and odors were eliminated. That's not all: the same life-support system also
maintained the cabin at the right pressure, provided hot and cold water, and a circulating 
coolant to keep all the electronic gear at the proper temperature. (In the weightless
environment of space, there are no convective currents, and equipment must be cooled
by means of circulating fluids.) Because astronauts' lives depended on this systern,
most of the functions were provided with redundancy - and yet the entire unit was not
much bigger than a window air conditioner.

<br><br>
<center>
<table border=0 width=80%><tr>
<td><img src="i4-3.jpg" ALT="A picture of the cross-section of the command module and the service module">
<td valign=bottom><font size=2>
Above: Looking like a huge toy top
the conical command module
was crammed with some of
the most complex equipment
ever sent into space. The three
astronaut couches were surrounded by instrument panels,
navigation gear, radios, life-support systems, and small 
engines to keep it stable during
reentry. The entire cone, 11
feet long and 13 feet in diameter, was protected by a
charring heat shield. The 6.5-ton CM was all that was
finally left of the 3000-ton
Saturn V stack that lifted oft
on the journey to the Moon.
<br><br>
Below: Packed with plumbing and
tanks, the service module was
the CM's constant companion
until just before reentry. So
all components not needed
during the last few minutes of
flight, and therefore requiring
no protection against reentry
heat, were transported in this
module. It carried oxygen for
most of the trip; fuel cells to
generate electricity (along
with the oxygen and hydrogen to run them); 
small engines to control pitch, roll,
and yaw; and a large engine
to propel the spacecraft into -and out of- lunar orbit.

<table border=0 width=70%><tr><td>&nbsp;<tr><td align=center><font size=2>
The lunar module was also a two-part
spacecraft. Its lower or descent stage had the landing
gear and engines and fuel
needed for the landing. When
the LM blasted off the Moon,
the descent stage served as
the launching pad for its
companion ascent stage,
which was also home for the
two explorers on the surface.
In function if not in looks the
LM was like the CM, full of
gear to communicate, navigate, and rendezvous. But it
also had its own propulsion
system, an engine to lift it off
the Moon and send it on a
course toward the command
module orbiting above.

<br><br>
How do you generate enough electric power to run a ship in space? In the CSM,
the answer was fuel cells; in the LM, storage batteries. Apollo fuel cells used oxygen
and hydrogen -stored as liquids at extremely cold temperatures- that when combined
chemically yielded electric power and, as a byproduct, water for drinking. (In early
flights the water contained entrapped bubbles of hydrogen, which caused the astronauts
no real harm but engendered major gastronomical discomfort. This led to loud complaints, 
and the problem was finally solved by installing special diaphragms in the
system.) The fuel-cell power system was efficient, clean, and absolutely pollution-free.
Storing oxygen and hydrogen required new advances in leakproof insulated containers.
lf an Apollo hydrogen tank were filled with ice and placed in a room at 70 F, it
would take 8.5 years for the ice to melt. lf an automobile tire leaked at the same rate
as these tanks, it would take 30 million years to go flat.
<br><br>
"Houston, this is Tranquility." These words soon would be heard from another
world, coming from an astronaut walking on the Moon, relayed to the LM, then to a
tracking station in Australia or Spain or California, and on to Mission Control in
Houston with only two seconds' delay. Communications from the Moon were clearer
and certainly more reliable than they were from my home in Nassau Bay (a stone's
throw from the Manned Spacecraft Center) to downtown Houston. At the same time,
a tiny instrument would register a reading in the astronauts' life-support system, and
a few seconds later an engineer in Mission Control would see a variation in oxygen
pressure, or a doctor a change in heart rate; and around the world people would watch
on their home television sets. Bebind all of this would be the Apollo communications
system-designed to be the astronauts' life line back to Earth, to be compact and
lightweight, and yet to function with absolute reliability; an array of receivers, 
transmitters, power supplies and antennas, all tuned to perfection, that allowed the men and
equipment on the ground to extend the capabilities of the astronauts and their ships.
(Later on, when the computer on Apollo 11's LM was overloaded during the critical
final seconds of the landing, it was this communications system that enabled a highly
skilled flight controller named Steve Bales to tell Neil Armstrong that it was safe to
disregard the overload alarms and to go ahead with the lunar landing.)

Like a plumber's dream, the LM's environmental control system nestled in
a corner of the ascent stage. Those
hoses provided pure oxygen to two astronauts at a pressure one-third that
of normal atmosphere, and at a comfortable temperature. The unit 
recirculated the gas, scrubbed out CO<sub>2</sub> and
moisture exhaled, and replenished oxygen as it was used up.

<br><br>

If you had to single out one subsystem as being most important, most complex,
and yet most demanding in performance and precision, it would be Guidance and
Navigation. Its function: to guide Apollo across 250,000 miles of empty space; achieve
a precise orbit around the Moon; land on its surface within a few yards of a predesignated 
spot; guide LM from the surface to a rendezvous in lunar orbit; guide the CM
to hit the Earth's atmosphere within a 27-mile "corridor" where the air was thick
enough to capture the spacecraft, and yet thin enough so as not to burn it up; and
finally land it close to a recovery ship in the middle of the Pacific Occan. Designed by
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under Stark Draper's leadership, G&N consisted 
of a miniature computer with an incredible amount of information in its memory;
an array of gyroscopes and accelerometers called the inertial-measurement unit; and
a space sextant to enable the navigator to take star sightings. Together they determined
precisely the spacecraft location between Earth and Moon, and how best to burn the
engines to correct the ship's course or to land at tbe right spot on the Moon with a
minimum expenditure of fuel. Precision was of utmost importance; there was no
margin for error, and there were no reserves for a missed approach to the Moon. In
Apollo 11, Eagle landed at Tranquility Base, after burning its descent engine for 12
minutes, with only 20 seconds of landing fuel remaining.

Here Walt Cunningham makes his

space, and a computer to link the data and make 
the most complex and precise calculations.
</table>
</center>
<br><br>

But the guidance system only told us where the spacecraft was and how to correct
its course. It provided the brain, while the propulsion system provided the brawn in
the form of rocket engines, propellant tanks, valves, and plumbing. There were 50
engines on the spacecraft, smaller but much more numerous than those on the combined 
three stages of the Saturn that provided the launch toward the Moon. Most of
them - 16 on the LM, 16 on the SM, and 12 on the CM - furnished only 100 pounds
of thrust apiece; they oriented the craft in any desired direction just as an aircraft's
elevators, ailerons, and rudder control pitch, roll, and yaw.
<br><br>
Three of the engines were much larger. On the service module a 20,500-pound-thrust 
engine injected Apollo into lunar orbit, and later brought it back home; on the
LM there was a 10,500-pound-thrust engine for descent, and a 3500 pounder for
ascent. All three had to work: a failure would have stranded astronauts on the Moon
or in lunar orbit. They were designed with reliabillty as the number one consideration.
They used hypergolic propellants that burned spontaneously on contact and required
no spark plugs; the propellants were pressure-fed into the thrust chamber by bottled
helium, eliminating complex pumps; and the rocket nozzles were coated with an ablative 
material for heat protection, avoiding the need for intricate cooling systems.
<br><br>
Three other engines could provide instant thrust at launch to get the spacecraft
away from the Saturn if it should inadvertently tumble or explode. The largest of these
produced 160,000 pounds of thrust, considerably more than the Redstone booster
which propelled Alan Shepard on America's first manned spaceflight. (Since we never
had an abort at launch, these three were never used.)

<table border=0 width=80%><tr>
<td><img src="i4-8.jpg" ALT="A photo of 4 small rocket engines">
<td valign=bottom><font size=2>
Because there is no air to deflect, a spacecraft
lacks rudders or ailerons. Instead, it has small
rocket engines to pitch it up or down, to yaw it
left or right, or to roll it about one axis. Sixteen
of them were mounted on the service module, in
"quads" of four. Here one quad is tested to make
sure that hot rocket exhaust will not burn a hole
in the spacecraft's thin skin.

Similar in shape but not size were the three big
engines aboard Apollo spacecraft. Two of them
had no backup, so they were designed to be the
most reliable engines ever built. lf the service-propulsion engine 
failed in lunar orbit, three
astronauts would be unable to return home; if the
ascent engine failed on the Moon, it would leave
two explorers stranded. (A descent-engine failure
would not be as critical, because the ascent engine
might be used to save the crew members.)

<br><br>

There were other subsystems, each with its own intricacies of design, and, more
often than not, with its share of problems. There were displays and controls, backup
guidance systems, a lunar landing gear on the LM and an Earth landing system 
(parachutes) on the CM, and a docking system designed with the precision of a Swiss watch,
yet strong enough to stop a freight car. There were also those things that fell between
the subsystems: wires, tubes, plumbing, valves, switches, relays, circuit breakers, and
explosive charges that started, stopped, ejected. separated, or otherwise activated
various sequences.

 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
 <h3>CHAPTER 4.4</h3>
 <hr><br>
</center>

<h3>A TRAGIC FIRE TAKES THREE LIVES</h3>

Apollo in January 1967 was adjudged almost ready for its first manned flight in
Earth orbit. And then disaster. A routine test of Apollo on the launching pad at Cape
Kennedy. Three astronauts - Grissom, White, and Chaffee - in their spacesuits in a
100-percent oxygen environment. A tiny spark, perhaps a short circuit in the wiring.
It was all over in a matter of seconds. Yet it would be 21 months before Apollo would
again be ready to fly.

<br><br>
By April 1967, when I was given the Apollo spacecraft job, an investigation board
had completed most of its work. The board was not able to pinpoint the exact cause
of the fire, but this only made matters worse bccause it meant that there were probably
flaws in several areas of the spacecraft. These included the cabin environment on the
launch pad, the amount of combustible material in the spacecraft, and perhaps most
important, the control (or lack of control) of changes.
<br><br>
Apollo would fly in space with a pure oxygen atmosphere at 5 psi (pounds per
square inch), about one-third the pressure of the air we breathe. But on the launching
pad, Apollo used pure oxygen at 16 psi, slightly above the pressure of the outside air.
Now it happens that in oxygen at 5 psi things will generally burn pretty much as they
do in air at normal pressures. But in 16 psi oxygen most nonmetallic materials will
burn explosively; even steel can be set on fire. Mistake number one: Incredible as it
may sound in hindsight, we had all been blind to this problem. In spite of all the care,
all the checks and balances, all the "what happens if's", we had overlooked the hazard
on the launching pad.

The pedigree of just one Apollo
spacecraft took this many books.
A mind-numbing degree of documentation contributed to reliability,
safety, and success. lf one batch of
one alloy in one part was found to
be faulty, for example, a search
could show if the bad material had
found its way into other spacecraft,
to lie in wait there.

Inspecting the new hatch, Wally Schirra makes 
sure his crew cannot be trapped as was the
crew that died in the terrible Apollo spacecraft 
fire. Opening outward (to swing freely if pressure 
built up inside), the new hatch had to be much 
sturdier than the old inward-opening one.
The complicated latch sealed against tiny 
leaks but allowed very rapid release.
</table>
</center>

<br>

Most nonmetallic things will burn - even in air or 5 psi oxygen - unless they are
specially formulated or treated. Somehow, over the years of development and test, too
many nonmetals had crept into Apollo. The cabin was full of velcro cloth, a sort of
space-age baling wire, to help astronauts store and attach their gear and checklists.
There were paper books and checklists, a special kind of plastic netting to provide more
storage space, and the spacesuits themselves, made of rubber and fabric and plastic.
Behind the panels there were wires with nonmetallic insulation, and switches and circuit 
breakers in plastic cases. There were also gobs of insulating material called RTV.
(In Gordon Cooper's Mercury flight, some important electronic gear had malfunctioned 
because moisture condensed on its uninsulated terminals. The solution for
Apollo had been to coat all electronic connections with RTV, which performed admirably 
as an insulator, but, as we found out later, burned in an oxygen environment.)
Mistake number two: Far too much nonmetallic material had been incorporated in
the construction of the spacecraft.

After the fire, flammability and

aftermath: a fire that initially
propagated but soon extinguished
itself. It took great effort and
ingenuity to devise materials that
would not burn violently in the
pure-oxygen atmosphere. lf a
test was not satisfactory and a
fire did not put itself out, the
material or wire routing was redesigned 
and then retested.

preflight trials could easily lay the groundwork 
for disaster out in unforgiving space.

<br><br>
There is an old saying that airplanes and spacecraft won't fly until the paper
equals their weight. There was a time when two men named Orville and Wilbur Wright
could, unaided, design and build an entire airplane, and even make its engine. But
those days are long gone. When machinery gets as complex as the Apollo spacecraft,
no single person can keep all of its details in his head. Paper, therefore, becomes of
paramount importance: paper to record the exact confiugration; paper to list every
nut and bolt and tube and wire, paper to record the precise size, shape, constitution.
history, and pedigree of every piece and every part. The paper tells where it was made,
who made it, which batch of raw materials was used, how it was tested, and how it
performed. Paper becomes particularly important when a change is made, and changes
must be made whenever design, engineering, and development proceed simultaneously
as they did in Apollo. There are changes to make things work, and changes to replace a
component that failed in a test, and changes to ease an astronaut's workload or to make
it difficult to flip the wrong switch.

Meant to fly in a vacuum, and to survive fiery reentry, 
the command module had also to serve as a
boat. Although its parachutes appeared to lower it
gently, its final impact velocity was still a jarring
20 mph. Tests like this one established its resistance 
to the mechanical and thermal shocks of impact, and its ability to float afterward.

Hitting land was possible, even though water was the
expected landing surface. For this, a shock-absorbing
honeycomb between the heat shield and the inner shell
was one protection, along with shock absorbers on the
couch supports. A third defense against impact was
the way each couch was molded to its astronaut's size
and shape, to provide him with the maximum support.
</table>
</center>

<br><br>

Mistake number three: In the rush to prepare Apollo for flight, the control of
changes had not been as rigorous as it should have been, and the investigation board
was unable to determine the precise detailed configuration of the spacecraft, how it was
made, and what was in it at the time of the accident. Three mistakes, and perhaps more,
added up to a spark, fuel for a fire, and an environment to make the fire explosive in its
nature. And three fine men died.

</center>

<h3>AND THEN THE REBUILDING BEGAN</h3>

Now time was running out. The race against time began, with only 33 months
remaining from April 1967 and the end of the decade. The work to be done appeared
to be overwhelming and dictated 18-hour days, seven days a week. My briefcase was
my office, my suitcase my home, as I moved from Houston to Downey, to Bethpage, to
Cape Kennedy, and back to Houston again. At Tranquility Base, the Sun would only
rise 33 more times before 1970.
<br><br>
Rebuilding meant changes and changes meant trouble if they were not kept under
perfect control. Our solution was the CCB, the Configuration Control Board. On it
were some of the best engineers in the world: my two deputies, Ken Kleinknecht and
Rip Bolender; Apollo's Assistant for Flight Safety, Scott Simpkinson; Max Faget,
Houston's Chief Engineer, Chris Kraft, the Chief of Flight Operations; Deke Slayton,
the head of the astronauts; Dale Myers for North American Rockwell, and Joe Gavin
for Grumman. The Board was rounded out with Chuck Berry for medical inputs and
Bill Hess for science. It was organized by my technical assistant, George Abbey, who
knew everything about everybody on Apollo, and who was always able to get things
done. I was its chairman and made all decisions. Arguments sometimes got pretty hot as
technical alternatives were explored. In the end I would decide, usually on the spot,
always explaining my decision openly and in front of those who liked it the least. To me,
this was the true test of a decision - to look straight into the eyes of the person most
affected by it, knowing full well that months later on the morning of a flight, I would
look into the eyes of the men whose lives would depend on that decision. One could not
make any mistakes.
<br><br>
When I wasn't sure of myself or when I didn't trust my judgement, I knew where
to go to get help - Bob Gilruth, my boss, who himself had been through every problem
in Mercury. An extremely able engineer, Bob had acquired great wisdom over the years
dealing with men and their flying machines. Bob was always there when I needed him.
<br><br>
The CCB met every Friday, promptly at noon, and often well into the night. From
June 1967 to July 1969 the Board met 90 times, considered 1697 changes and approved
1341. We dealt with changes large and small, discussed them in every technical detail,
and reviewed their cost and schedule impact. Was the change really necessary? What
were its effects on other parts of the machine, on computer programs, on the astronauts,
and on the ground tracking systems? Was it worth the cost, how long would it take,
and how much would it weigh?
<br><br>
We redesigned the command module hatch to open out instead of in, because the
old hatch had been a factor in trapping Grissom, White, and Chaffee inside their burning 
craft. This may sound simple, but it wasn't. An inward-opening hatch was much
easier to build, because when it was closed it tended to be self-sealing since the pressure
inside the spacecraft forced it shut. The opposite was true for an outward-opening
hatch, which had to be much sturdier, and hence heavier, with complicated latches.

Escape from disaster was the objective of
this spectacular test. The peril occurs in the
early moments of launch, when the Saturn V
contains thousands of tons of propellant. If
things go wrong, the manned command
module must be pulled away to a safe 
distance by the launch-escape rocket. Above,
the launch-escape rocket is fitted to a test
CM atop a Little Joe II booster. This booster,
far cheaper than a Saturn, can duplicate its
initial flight phases.

Up and away goes the command module,
when the solid-fuel escape rocket - a
single rocket firing through three nozzles - lights off. 
The sequence is begun only when
the booster has accelerated the command
module to "worst-case" speeds and heights.
As it happened, the escape system was never
needed during any of the Apollo launches.
</table>
</center>

<br><br>
We rewired the spacecraft rerouted wire bundles, and used better insulation on
the wires. We looked at every ounce of nonmetallic material, removed much of it, and
concocted new materials for insulation and for pressure suits. We invented an insulating 
coating that would not burn, only to find that it would absorb moisture and become
a conductor so we had to invent another one. Pressure suits had to shed their nylon
outer layer, to be replaced with a glass cloth; but the glass would wear away quickly,
and shed fine particles which contaminated the spacecraft and caused the astronauts
to itch. The solution was a coating for the alass cloth. We solved the problem of fire in
the space atmosphere of 5 psi oxygen, but try as we might, we could not make the ship
fireproof in the launch-pad atmosphere of 16 psi oxygen. Then Max Faget came up
with an idea: Launch with an atmosphcre that was 60 percent oxygen and 40 percent
nitrogen, and then slowly convert to pure oxygen after orbit had been reached and the
pressure was 5 psi. The 60-40 mixture was a delicate balance between medical 
requirements on the one hand (too much nitrogen would have caused the bends as the pressure
decreased) and flammability problems on the other. It worked.

<br><br>
Weight is a problem in the design of any flying machine. Apollo, with its many
chances, was anything but an exception. Problems are always easier to solve if one can
afford a little leeway for making a change, but difficult and expensive if there is no
weight margin. In the command module, we found a way to gain an extra 1000 pound
margin by redesigning the parachute to handle a heavier CM. This margin made other
CM changes relatively simple, and certainly less costly and time consuming.
<br><br>
For LM there was no such solution. We had to shave an ounce here, another
there, to make room for the changes that had to be made. It was difficult, lengthy, and
expensive.

<h3>TESTING AND RETESTING TO GET READY FOR FLIGHT</h3>

We tested for "sneak circuits" (inadvertent electrical paths), discovered some,
and made changes. We ran a "failure mode and effects analysis" - a search for all the
"what happens if's" - and made more changes. We tested, and retested, and changed
and fixed and tested again. We set off small explosive charges inside the burning rocket
engines, and to our horror found the all-important LM ascent engine was prone to
catastrophic instability - a way of burning that could destroy the engine on takeoff and
leave the astronauts stranded on the Moon. Much to the consternation of my bosses in
Washington, we sent out new bids and selected a different contractor who built a new
engine faster than anyone believed possible. But it worked.
<br><br>
No detail was too small to consider. We asked questions, received answers, asked
more questions. We woke up in the middle of the night, remembering questions we
should have asked, and jotted them down so we could ask them in the morning. If we
made a mistake, it was not because of any lack of candor between NASA and contractor, 
or between engineer and astronaut; it was only because we weren't smart enough
to ask all the right questions. Every question was answered, every failure understood,
every problem solved.
<br><br>
We built mockups of the entire spacecraft, and tried to set them on fire. If they
burned, we redesigned, rebuilt, and tried again. By vibration we tried to shake things
apart; we tested in chambers simulating the vacuum of space, the heat of the Sun, and
the cold of the lunar night. We subjected all systems to humidity and salt spray, to the
noise of the booster, and the shock of a hard landing. We dropped the command
module into water to simulate normal landings and on land to test for emergeng 
landings; we plopped the lunar module on simulated lunar terrain. We overstressed and
overloaded until things broke, and if they broke too soon, we redesigned and rebuilt
and tested again.
<br><br>
The final exam came in flight. First the command module was tested with only
the launch-escape tower, against the possibility of a Saturn exploding on the launch
pad. Then we launched the CSM on a special booster, the Little Joe II, to see whether
it would survive if the Saturn should fail in the atmosphere, when air loads are at their
peak. (There is a big difference between manned and unmanned fllght. If the launch
vehicle should stray off course while lifting an automated payload, the range safety
officer could press a button and destroy booster and payload together; in manned flight
the spacecraft would first be separated from the errant booster, which would then be
blown up before it wandered off, leaving the CM to be carried to safety by the launch
escape tower. This separation maneuver demanded the utmost in speed and power.)
<br><br>
The CSM, unmanned was flown twice on the Saturn IB (1,600,000 pounds
of thrust). Then, on November 9, 1967, came the most critical test of all: Apollo 4, the
first flight of the Saturn V (7,500,000 pounds), would subject the CSM to the lunar
return speed of 25,000 mph. After achieving an altitude of 10,000 miles, the spacecraft's 
engines drove Apollo back down into the atmosphere at unprecedented speed.
Temperatures on the heat shield reached 5000 F, more than half the surface temperature 
of the Sun. The heat shield charred as expected, but the inside of the cabin remained 
at a comfortable 70 F. A major milestone had been passed.
<br><br>
Apollo 5 on January 22, 1968, was the first flight test of LM - an unmanned
flight in Earth orbit that put the lunar module through its paces. There were problems.
The computer shut down the LM's descent engine prematurely on its first burn. But
then the flight controllers on the ground took over and continued the flight with an
alternate mission. Now another question arose: Should we repeat this flight? Grumman
felt we should, I disagreed. After considerable technical debate, we decided that the
next flight with LM would be manned - which it was, 14 months later.
<br><br>
Apollo 6, three months after Apollo 5, was to be a simple repeat of Apollo 4, but
it wasn't. The Saturn had problems, and so did the spacecraft adapter - that long 
conical section which joined the CSM to the booster, and which also served as LM's
cocoon. (The spacecraft itself did a beautiful job.) After a fantastic piece of detective
work by Don Arabian, our chief test engineer, wo found a flaw in the manufacturing
of the honeycomb structure of the adapter, and how to fix it.
<br><br>
October 11, 1968. Eichteen months since that day in the pilot's lounge at Washington 
Airport when I said yes, I would take on Apollo. Eighteen of the greatest months
an engineer could ask for. In that time 150,000 Americans had worked around the
clock, dedicating their skills and their lives to forge two of the most magnificent flying
machines yet devised: CSM and LM. It was a beautiful morning in Florida, just the
kind of morning for another launch. This time Apollo was ready for its men.

<h2>Scouting the Moon</h2>

Our first look at Earth rise over the eastern rim of the Moon was radioed
back by Lunar Orbiter I on August 23,1966. At the moment this picture was shot,
the spacecraft was flying 730 miles above the lunar far side. The photo gave 
man a disarming view of his own world. But the sweep of tortured lunar surface
revealed in the Orbiter pictures was a dramatic preview of the unearthly realm
that the Apollo astronauts would soon see.
</table>
</center>
<br>

After centuries of studying the Moon and its motions, most astronomers faced
with diminishing returns - had abandoned it to lovers and poets by the time that
Sputnik ushered in the space age. The hardy few who had not been wooed away to
greener astronomical pastures were soon to be richly rewarded for their patience.

<br><br>
Before the invention of the telescope in 1608, astronomers had to be content with
two good eyes and a fertile imagination to surmise the nature of the lunar surface. 
As a consequence they mainly devoted themselves to the mathematics of the Moon's
motions relative to the Earth and Sun. The early telescopes that first revealed the
crater-pocked face of the Moon touched off several centuries of speculation about the
lunar surface by scientists and fiction writers alike - it often being unclear who was
writing the fiction. But telescopes peering through the turbulent atmosphere of Earth
have severe limitations. By 1956 the very best terrestrial telescope images of the Moon
were only able to resolve objects about the size of the U.S. Capitol. Anything smaller
was a mystery.
<br><br>

Galileo drew the Moon in 1610 and described its
surface as "uneven, rough, replete with cavities and
packed with protruding eminences." While a correct description, 
his details are unrecognizable now.
<td align=center><font size=2>
Harold Urey enhanced our view of the lunar surface 
by creating this montage made from segments
of Lick Observatory photos taken when the Sun
angle was low so that shadows emphasized relief.
</table>
</center>
<br>

So the question remained: What was the lunar surface really like? While few
people really believed the Moon to be made of green cheese, many scientific hypotheses
cherished not long ago were equally strange and rather more ominous. They included
deep fields of dust into which a spacecraft might sink; a labyrinth of "fairy castles" such
as children build by dripping wet sand at the beach; electrostatic dust that might spring
up and engulf an alien object; and treacherously covered crevasses into which an unwary 
astronaut might fall. What proved to be the most accurate prediction, however,
likened the Moon to a World War I battlefield, bombarded by a rain of meteoroids
throughout the millennia, and churned into a wasteland of craters and debris. The
absence of an atmosphere and the low gravitational field would allow small secondary
particles to be blasted from the surface by a primary meteoroid impact and thrown
unimpeded halfway around the Moon. This led to the concept of a uniform blanket of
ejecta over the entire Moon.

<br>

But our story is getting ahead of itself. The surface properties of the Moon were
largely unknown in 1958, a matter which assumed great practical importance when
man's first journeys to the Moon began to take shape. How much weight would the
surface support? What were the slopes? Were there many rocks - and of what size?
Would the dust or dirt cling? What was the intensity of primary and secondary meteoroid 
bombardment? What was the exact size and shape of the Moon, and what were
the details of the lunar gravity field into which our spaceships would one day plunge?

<h3>A SHAKY START</h3>

The military rockets developed in the 1950s provided a basic tool with which it
became possible to send rudimentary spacecraft to the Moon. Both the Army and the
Air Force were quick to initiate efforts to be the first to the Moon with a manmade
object. (The Russians, as it proved, were equally quick, or quicker.) These first U.S.
projects, which were transferred in 1958 to the newly formed National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, consisted of four Air Force Thor-Able rockets, and two Army
Juno II rockets, each with tiny payloads, designed to measure radiation and magnetic
fields near the Moon and, in some cases, to obtain rudimentary pictures. NASA and
the Air Force then added three Atlas-Abie rockets, which could carry heavier payloads, 
in an attempt to bolster these early high-risk efforts. Of these nine early missions
launched between August 1958 and December 1960, none really succeeded. Two
Thor-Able and all three Atlas-Able vehicles were destroyed during launch. One Thor-Able 
and one of the Juno II's did not attain sufficient velocity to reach the Moon and
fell back to Earth. Two rockets were left.

Mankind's first glimpse of the far side of the Moon came
in October 1959, provided by the Soviet spacecraft Luna
3. Although crude compared with later views, its pictures
showed a number of lunar features for the first time. One
of these was the crater Tsiolkovsky, named for the famed
Russian mathematician, which appears here in the lower
right as a small sea with an island in it. The images from
Luna 3 indicated that the Moon's far side lacked the large
mare areas an the side facing Earth.

<br>

The Soviets were also having problems. But on January 4, 1959, Luna 1, the first
space vehicle to reach escape velocity, passed the Moon within about 3700 miles and
went into orbit about the Sun. Two months later the United States repeated the feat
with the last Juno II, although its miss distance was 37,300 miles. A year later the last
Thor-Able payload flew past the Moon, but like its predecessors it yielded no new information 
about the surface. On October 7, 1959, the Soviet Luna 3 became the first
spacecraft to photograph another celestial body, radioing to Earth crude pictures of the
previously unseen far side of the Moon. The Moon was not a "billboard in the sky"
with slatted back and props. Its far side was found to be cratered, as might be expected,
but unlike the front there were no large mare basins. The primitive imagery that Luna
3 returned was the first milepost in automated scientific exploration of other celestial
bodies.

A sophisticated craft for its day, the
800-lb Ranger or its launch vehicle
failed in its first six tries. Then it behaved beautifully, returning thousands
of pictures in its last three flights, most
of them far superior to the best that
could be obtained from telescopes on
Earth. Rangers crashed on the Moon at
nonsurvivable velocity; their work was
done in the few short moments from
camera turn-on to impact.

nothing that discouraged Apollo planners, although they did indicate that
choosing an ideally smooth site for a
manned landing was not going to be an
easy task.

Undaunted by initial failures, and certainly spurred on by Soviet efforts, a NASA
team began to plan a long-term program of lunar exploration that would embody all
necessary ingredients for success. The National Academy of Sciences was enlisted to
help draw the university community into the effort. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
California Institute of Technology affiliate that had been transferred from the Army
to NASA in 1958, was selected to carry out the program. JPL was already experienced
in rocketry and had participated in the Explorer and Pioneer IV projects.

 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
 <h3>CHAPTER 5.3</h3>
 <hr><br>
</center>

<h3>OUR FIRST CLOSE LOOK</h3>

The first project to emerge from this government/university team was named
Ranger, to connote the exploration of new frontiers. Subsequently Surveyor and Prospector 
echoed this naming theme. (Planetary missions adopted nautical names such as
Mariner, Voyager, and Viking.) The guideline instructions furnished JPL for Ranger
read in part: "The lunar reconnaissance mission has been selected with the major
objective . . . being the collection of data for use in an integrated lunar-exploration
program. . . . The [photographic] system should have an overall resolution of sufficient
capability for it to be possible to detect lunar details whose characteristic dimension is
as little as 10 feet." Achieving this goal did not come about easily.

The Surveyor mission had been conceived in 1959 as
a scheme to soft-land scientific instruments an the
Moon's surface. It was a highly ambitious plan that
required both development of a radical new launch
vehicle and the new technology of a closed-loop,
radar-controlled automated landing. The cutaway
drawing shows the Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle. 
The Atlas-Centaur, a major step forward in rocket propulsion,
was the first launch vehicle to use the high-energy
propellant combination of hydrogen and oxygen. Its
new Centaur upper stage, built by General Dynamics,
had two Pratt & Whitney RL-10 engines of 15,000-lb thrust each. 
The first stage was a modified Atlas D
having enlarged tanks and increased thrust.

The initial choice of launch vehicle for the Ranger was the USAF Atlas, mated
with a new upper stage to be developed by JPL, the Vega. Subsequently NASA cancelled 
the Vega in favor of an equivalent vehicle already under development by the
Air Force, the Agena. This left JPL free to concentrate on the Ranger. The spacecraft
design that evolved was very ambitious for its day, incorporating solar power, full
three-axis stabilization, and advanced communications. Clearly JPL also had its eye on
the planets in formulating this design.

Of a total of nine Rangers launched between 1961 and 1965, only the last three
succeeded. From the six failures we learned many lessons the hard way. Early in the
program, an attempt was made to protect the Moon from earthly contamination by
sterilizing the spacecraft in an oven. This technique, which is now being used on the
Mars/Viking spacecraft, had to be abandoned at that time when it wreaked havoc
with Ranger's electronic subsystems.
<br><br>
In the first two launches in 1961 the new Agena B upper stage failed to propel
the Ranger out of Earth orbit. Failures in both the launch vehicle and spacecraft misdirected 
the third flight. On the fourth flight the spacecraft computer and sequencer
malfunctioned. And on the fifth flight a failure occurred in the Ranger power system.
The U.S. string of lunar missions with little or no success had reached fourteen. Critics
were clamoring that Ranger was a "shoot and hope" project. NASA convened a failure
review board, and its studies uncovered weaknesses in both the design and testing of
Ranger. Redundancy was added to electronic circuits and test procedures were tightened. 
As payload Ranger VI carried a battery of six television cameras to record surface 
details during the final moments before impact. When it was launched on January
30, 1964, we had high confidence of success. Everything seemed to work perfectly.
But when the spacecraft plunged to the lunar surface, precisely on target, its cameras
f ailed to turn on. I will never forget the feeling of dismay in the JPL control room that
day.

<br><br>

<table border=0 width=70%><tr><td>
<img src="i5-8a.jpg" ALT="Photo of crater Calaverius"> 
<td valign=bottom><font size=2>
The first lunar soft landing was accomplished
by Russia's Luna 9 on February 3, 1966, about
60 miles northeast of the crater Calaverius.
Its pictures showed details down to a tenth of
an inch five feet away. They indicated no
loose dust layer, both rounded and angular
rock fragments, numerous small craters, some
with slope angles exceeding 40 degrees, and
generally granular surface material. These
results increased confidence that the Moon was
not dangerously soft for a manned landing.

Surveyor I televised excellent pictures of the depth of the 
depression in the lunar soil made by its footpad when
it soft-landed on June 2, 1966, four months after Luna 9. 
Calculations from these and similar images set at rest
anxieties about the load-bearing adequacy of the Moon. 
Some scientists had theorized that astronauts could be
engulfed in dangerously deep dust layers, but Surveyor's 
footpad pictures, as well as the digging done by the
motorized scoop on board, indicated that the Moon would 
readily support the LM and its astronauts.
</table>
</center>
<br>

But we all knew we were finally close. Careful detective work with the telemetry
records identified the most probable cause as inadvertent turn-on of the TV transmitter 
while Ranger was still in the Earth's atmosphere, whereupon arcing destroyed
the system. The fix was relatively simple, although it delayed the program for three
months. On July 28, 1964, Ranger VII was launched on what proved to be a perfect
mission. Eighteen minutes before impact in Oceanus Procellarum, or Ocean of Storms,
the cameras began transmitting the first of 4316 excellent pictures of the surface.
The final frame was taken only 1400 feet above the surface and revealed details down
to about 3 feet in size. It was a breathless group of men that waited the arrival of the
first quick prints in the office of Bill Pickering, JPL's Director. The prints had not
been enhanced and it was hard to see the detail because of lack of contrast. But those
muddy little pictures with their ubiquitous craters seemed breathtakingly beautiful
to us.
<br><br>
By the time of the Ranger VII launch, the Apollo program had already been
underway for three years, and Ranger had been configured and targeted to scout possible 
landing sites. Thus Ranger VIII was flown to a flat area in the Sea of Tranquility
where it found terrain similar to that in the Ocean of Storms: gently sloping plains
but craters everywhere. It began to look as if the early Apollo requirement of a relatively 
large craterless area would be difficult to find. As far as surface properties were
concerned, the Ranger could contribute little to the scientific controversy raging over
whether the Moon would support the weight of a machine - or a man.

which was clean after first landing. Afterward,
the chart was coated with an adhering layer of fine soil

<br><br>

To get maximum resolution of surface details, it was necessary to rotate Ranger
so that the cameras looked precisely along the flight path. This was not done on Ranger
VII in order to avoid the risk of sending extra commands to the attitude-control system. 
I recall that on Ranger VIII JPL requested permission to make the final maneuver. 
NASA denied permission - we were still unwilling, after the long string of failures,
to take the slightest additional risk. It was not until Ranger IX that JPL made tbe
maneuver and achieved resolution approaching 1 foot in the last frame. This final
Ranger, launched on March 21, 1965, was dedicated to lunar science rather than to
reconnaissance of Apollo landing sites. It returned 5814 photographs of the crater
Alphonsus, again showing craters within craters, and some rocks. Despite its dismal
beginnings the Ranger program was thus concluded on a note of success. Proposed
follow-on missions were cancelled in favor of upcoming Surveyor and Orbiter missions,
whose development had been proceeding concurrently.

 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
 <h3>CHAPTER 5.4</h3>
 <hr><br>
</center>

<h3>TESTING THE SURFACE</h3>

Surveyor, which had been formally approved in the spring of 1960, was originally
conceived for the scientific investigation of the Moon's surface. As in the case of the
Ranger, its use was redirected according to the needs of Apollo.
<br><br>
With the proposed addition of an orbiting version of Surveyor, later to become
Lunar Orbiter, the unmanned lunar-exploration program in support of Apollo shaped
up this way: Ranger would provide us with our first look at the surface, Surveyor would
make spot checks of the mechanical properties of the surface; and Lunar Orbiter would
supply data for mapping and landing-site selection. The approach was sound enough,
but carrying it out led us into a jungle of development difficulties.
<br><br>
Few space projects short of Apollo itself embodied the technological audacity of
Surveyor. Its Atlas-based launch vehicle was to make use of an entirely new upper
stage, the Centaur, the world's first hydrogen-fueled rocket. It had been begun by the
Department of Defense and later transferred to NASA. Surveyor itself was planned
to land gently on the lunar surface, set down softly by throttable retrorockets under
control of its own radar system. It was to carry 350 pounds of complex 
scientific instruments. 
Responsibility for continuing the Centaur development was placed with the
Marshall Space Flight Center, with General Dynamics the prime contractor. JPL took
on the task of developing the Surveyor, and the Hughes Aircraft Company won the
competition for building it. We soon found that it was a very rough road. Surveyor
encountered a host of technical problems that caused severe schedule slips, cost growth,
and weight growth. The Centaur fared little better. Its first test flight in 1962 was a
failure. Its lunar payload dropped from the planned 2500 pounds to an estimated 1800
pounds or less - not sufficient for Surveyor. Its complex multistart capability was in
trouble. Wernher von Braun, necessarily preoccupied with the development of Saturn,
recommended cancelling Centaur and using a Saturn-Agena combination for Surveyor.
<br><br>
At this point we regrouped. Major organizational changes were made at JPL
and Hughes to improve the development and testing phases of Surveyor. NASA management 
of Centaur was transferred to the Lewis Research Center under the leadership 
of Abe Silverstein, where it would no loncer have to compete with Saturn for
the attention it needed to succeed. Its initial capabilities were targeted to the minimum
required for a Surveyor mission - 2150 pounds on a lunar-intercept trajectory. 
This reduced 
weight complicated work on an already overweight Surveyor, and the scientific
payload dropped to about 100 pounds.
<br><br>
It all came to trial on May 31, 1966, when Surveyor I was launched atop an
Atlas-Centaur for the first U.S. attempt at a soft landing. On June 2, Surveyor I
touched down with gentle perfection on a level plain in the Ocean of Storms, Oceanus
Procellarum. A large covey of VIPs had gathered at the JPL control center to witness
the event. One of them, Congressman Joseph E. Karth, whose Space Science and
Applications Subcommittee watched over both Surveyor and Centaur, had been both a
strong supporter and, at times, a tough critic of the program. The odds for success
on this complex and audacious first mission were not high. I can still see his broad
grin at the moment of touchdown, a grin which practically lighted up his corner of
the darkened room. We sat up most of the night watching the first of the 11,240 pictures 
that Surveyor I was to transmit.
<br><br>
Four months prior to Surveyor's landing, on February 3, 1966, the Russian Luna
9 landed about 60 miles northeast of the crater Calaverius, and radioed back to Earth
the first lunar-surface pictures. This was an eventful year in lunar exploration, for only
two months after Surveyor I, the U.S. Lunar Orbiter I usbered in that successful and
richly productive series of missions.

<br>

Surveyor found, as had Luna before it, a barren plain pitted with countless craters
and strewn with rocks of all sizes and shapes. No deep layer of soft dust was found,
and analysts estimatcd that the surface appeared to be firm enough for both spacecraft
and men. The Surveyor camera, which was more advanced than Luna's, showed very
fine detail. The first frame transmitted to Earth showed a footpad and its impression
on the lunar surface, which we had preprogrammed just in case that was the only
picture that could be received. At our first close glimpse of the disturbed lunar surface, 
the material seemed to behave like moist soil or wet sand, which, of course, it
was not. Its appearance was due to the cohesive nature of small particles in a vacuum.
<br><br>
Surveyor II tumbled during a midcourse maneuver and was lost, but on April
19, 1967, Surveyor III made a bumpy landing inside a 650-foot crater in the eastern
part of the Sea of Clouds. Its landing rockets had failed to cut off and it skittered down
the inner slope of a crater before coming to rest. Unlike its predecessors, Surveyor III
carried a remotely controlled device that could dig the surface. During the course of
digging, experimenters dropped a shovelful of lunar material on a footpad to examine
it more closely. When Surveyor III was visited by the Apollo 12 astronauts 30 months
later in 1970, the little pile was totally undisturbed, as can be seen in the photograph
reproduced at the beginning of Chapter 12.

<br><br>
The historic rendezvous of Apollo 12 with Surveyor III would never have been
possible without the patient detective work of Ewen Whitaker of the University of
Arizona. The difficulty was that the landing site of Surveyor was not precisely known.
Using Surveyor pictures of the inside of the crater in which it had landed, Whitaker
compared surface details with details visible in Orbiter photographs of the general area
that had been taken before the Surveyor landing. He eventually found a 650-foot crater
that matched, and concluded that that was where Surveyor must be. Thus the uncertainty 
in Surveyor's location was reduced from several miles down to a single crater.
By using Orbiter photographs as a guide, Apollo 12 was able to fly down a "cratered
trail" to a landing only 600 feet away from Surveyor.
<br><br>
Surveyor IV failed just minutes before touchdown, but the last three Surveyors
were successful. On September 10, 1967, Surveyor V landed on the steep inner slopes
of a 30 by 40 foot crater on Mare Tranquillitatis. It carried a new instrument, an 
alpha-backscattering device developed by Anthony Turkevich of the University of Chicago.
With this device he was able to make a fairly 
precise analysis of the chemical composition 
of the lunar-surface material, which he correctly identified as resembling terrestrial
basalts. This conclusion was also supported by the manner in which lunar material
adhered to several carefully calibrated magnets on Surveyor. Two days after landing,
Surveyor V's engines were reignited briefly to see what effect they would have on the
lunar surface. The small amounts of erosion indicated that this would pose no real
problem for Apollo, though perhaps causing some loss of visibility just before touchdown.

<br><br>
Surveyor VI checked out still another possible Apollo site in Sinus Medii. The
rocket-effects experiment was repeated and this time the Surveyor was "flown" to a
new location approximately 8 feet from the original landing point. Some of the soil
thrown out by the rockets stuck to the photographic target on the antenna boom, as
shown <a href="ch-5-3.html#soil">here</a>.

<br><br>
The last Surveyor was landed in a hiiyhland area just north of the crater Tycho
on January 9, 1968. A panoramic picture of this ejecta field taken by Surveyor VII is
shown <a href="ch-5-4.html#mosaic">here</a> as well as a mosaic of its surface "gardening" area. 
I remember
walking into the control room at JPL at the moment the experimenters were attempting
to free the backscatter instrument, which had hung up during deployment. Commands
were sent to the surface sampler to press down on it. The delicate operation was being
monitored and guided with Surveyor's television camera. When I started asking questions, 
Dr. Ron Scott of Cal Tech crisply reminded me that at the moment they were
"quite busy". I held my questions - and they got the stuck instrument down to the
surface. It seemed almost unreal to be remotely repairing a spacecraft on the Moon
some quarter of a million miles away.
<br><br>
Before the launch of Surveyor I, in the period when we faced cost overruns and
deep technical concerns, NASA and JPL had pressed the Hughes Aircraft Company
to accept a contract modification that would give up some profit already earned in
favor of increased fee opportunities in the event of mission successes. They accepted,
and this courageous decision paid off for both parties. NASA of course was delighted
with five out of seven Surveyor successes.

arrays shown, which delivered a maximum of 450 watts. The rocket
motor at top provided velocity changes for course corrections. Guidance 
was provided by inertial reference (three-axis gyros), celestial 
reference (Sun and Canopus sensors), and cold-gas jets to give
attitude control. Because it would necessarily be out of touch with
Earth during part of every orbit, it carried a computer-programmer
that could accept and later carry out up to 16 hours of automatic
sequenced operation.

It was in its photo system that Orbiter was most unconventional.
Other spacecraft took TV images and sent them back to Earth as
electrical signals. Orbiter took photographs, developed them on
board, and then scanned them with a special photoelectric system - a method 
that, for all its complications and limitations, could produce 
images of exceptional quality. One Orbiter camera could
resolve details as small as 3 feet from an altitude of 30 nautical
miles. A sample complication exacted by this performance: because
slow film had to be used (because of risk of radiation fogging),
slow shutter speeds were also needed. This meant that, to prevent
blurring from spacecraft motion, a velocity-height sensor had to
insure that the film was moved a tiny, precise, and compensatory
amount during the instant of exposure.
</table>

<br>
The five Orbiters accomplished more than photo reconnaissance
for Apollo. Sensors on board indicated that radiation levels found
near the Moon would pose no dangerous threat to astronauts. An
unexpected benefit came from careful analysis of spacecraft orbits,
which showed small perturbations suggesting that the Moon was
not gravitationally uniform, but had buried concentrations of mass.
By discovering and defining these "mascons", the Orbiters made
possible highly accurate landings and the precision rendezvous
that would characterize Apollo flights. Once their work was finished, 
the Orbiters were deliberately crashed on the Moon, so that
their radio transmitters would never interfere with later craft.

<h3>MAPPING AND SITE SELECTION</h3>

Meanwhile the third member of the automated lunar exploration team had
already completed its work. The fifth and last Lunar Orbiter had been launched on
August 1, 1967, nearly half a year earlier. When JPL and Hughes began to experience
difficulties with Surveyor development, and with the Centaur in deep trouble, NASA
decided to back up the entire proaram with a different team and different hardware.
The Surveyor Orbiter concept was scrapped, and NASA's Langley Research Center
was directed to plan and carry out a new Lunar Orbiter program, based on the less
risky Atlas-Acena D launch vehicle. Langley prepared the necessary specifications
and Boeing won the job. Boeing's proposed design was beautifully straightforward
except for one feature, the camera. Instead of being all-electronic as were prior space
cameras, the Eastman Kodak camera for the Lunar Orbiter made use of 70-mm film
developed on board the spacecraft and then optically scanned and telemetered to
Earth. Low-speed film had to be used so as not to be fogged by space radiation. This
in turn required the formidable added complexity of image-motion compensation during 
the instant of exposure. Theoretically, objects as small as three feet could be seen
from 30 nautical miles above the surface. If all worked well, this system could provide
the quality required for Apollo, but it was tricky, and it barely made it to the launch
pad in time to avoid rescheduling.

The youngest big crater on the Moon
is Tycho, which is about 53 miles
across and nearly 3 miles deep. These
Orbiter V photographs reveal its intricate structure. 
(Area in the rectangle above is pictured in higher
resolution below.) A high central peak
arises from the rough floor, and the
crater wall has extensively slumped.
The comparative scarcity of small
craters within Tycho indicate its relatively 
recent origin. Flow features
seen in both pictures could have been
molten lava, volcanic debris, or
fluidized impact-ejected material.
Surveyor VII landed about 18 miles
north of Tycho, in the area indicated
by the white circle above. Enlargements of these pictures show an
abundance of fissures and large fractured blocks, particularly near the

<br>

The Orbiter missions were designed to photograph all possible Apollo landing
sites, to measure meteoroid flux around the Moon, and to determine the lunar gravity
field precisely, from accurate tracking of the spacecraft. Orbiter did all 
these things - and more. 
As the primary objectives for Apollo program were essentially accomplished
on completion of the third mission, the fourth and fifth missions were devoted largely
to broader, scientific objectives - photography of the entire lunar nearside 
during Mission IV and photography of 36 areas of particular scientific interest on the near side
during Mission V. In addition, 99 percent of the far side was photographed in more
detail than Earth-based telescopes had previously photographed the front.

This breath-taking view was
one of Lunar Orbiter II's most
captivating photographic
achievements. For many people who had only seen an
Earth-based telescopic view
looking down into the crater
Copernicus, this oblique view
suddenly transformed that
static lunar feature into a
dramatic landscape with rolling mountains, sweeping 
palisades, and tumbling land-slides. The crater Copernicus
is about 60 miles in diameter,
2 miles deep, with 3000-foot
cliffs. Peaks near the center
of the crater form a mountain
range about 10 miles long
and 2000 feet high. Lunar
Orbiter II recorded this "picture of the year" on 
November 28, 1964, from 28.4 miles
above the surface when it
was about 150 miles due
south of the crater.
</table>
</center>
<br>

The first Lunar Orbiter spacecraft was launched on August 10, 1966, and photographed 
nine primary and seven secondary sites that were candidates for Apollo landings. 
The medium-resolution pictures were of good quality, but a malfunction in the
synchronization of the shutter caused loss of the high-resolution frames. In addition,
some views of the far side and oblique views of the Earth and Moon were also taken
(see <a href="ch-5-1.html#earthrise">here</a>). 
When we made the suggestion of taking this "Earthrise" picture, Boeing's 
project manager, Bob Helberg, reminded NASA that the spacecraft maneuver
required constituted a risk that could jeopardize the company profit, which was tied
to mission success. He then made the gutsy decision to go ahead anyway and we got
this historic photograph.

The best maps weren't good enough,
even though they were based an years of
telescopic photography from Earth. In
early planning, the rectangle in the map
at left was a possibility os a landing
site. The handful of craters shown, it
was innocently thought, should be easy
enough to dodge during the last moments
of a piloted landing. The site was an 11- by 20-mile rectangle located 
in the highlands west of Mare Tranquillitatis.

The truth about this site was revealed by the accurate 
eye of Lunar Orbiter II: it was far too rough
to be attempted in an early manned landing. 
In fact, Orbiter pictures showed that parts of the Moon
were as rough as a World War I battlefield, with 
craters within craters, and all parts of the surface
tilled and pulverized by a rocky rain. No areas were 
found smooth enough to meet the original
Apollo landing-site criteria, but a few approached 
it and the presence of a skilled pilot aboard the
LM to perform last-minute corrections mode landings 
possible. The high-quality imagery returned
by the Orbiters also returned a harvest of 
new scientific information.
</table>
</center>
<br>

The next two Lunar Orbiter missions were launched on November 6, 1966, and
February 4, 1967. They provided excellent coverage of all 20 potential Apollo landing
sites, additional coverage of the far side and other lunar 
features of scientific interest,
and many oblique views of lunar terrain as it might be seen by an orbiting astronaut.
One of these was a dramatic oblique photograph of the crater Copernicus, which
NASA's Associate Administrator, Dr. Robert C. Seamans, unveiled at a professional
society conference in Boston and which drew a standing ovation and designation as
"picture of the year". Among the possible Apollo sites photographed by Orbiter III
was the landing site of Surveyor I. Careful photographic detective work found the
shining Surveyor and its dark shadow among the myriad craters.
<br><br>
The Apollo site surveys yielded surprises. Some sites that had looked promising
in Earth-based photography were totally unacceptable. No sites were found to be as
free of craters as had been originally specified for Apollo, so the Langley lunar landing
facility was modified to give astronauts practice at crater dodging. Since the basic
Apollo photographic requirements were essentially satisfied by the first three flights,
the last two Orbiters launched on May 4 and August 1, 1967, were 
placed in high near-polar 
orbits from which they completed coverage of virtually the entire lunar surface.
<br><br>
The other Orbiter experiments were also productive. No unexpected levels of
radiation or meteoroids were found to offer a threat to astronaut safety. Studies of
the Orbiter motion, however, revealed relatively large gravitational variations due to
buried mass concentrations - the phrase was soon telescoped to "mascons" - in the
Moon's interior. This alerted Apollo planners to account properly for mascon perturbations 
when calculating precise Apollo trajectories.
<br><br>
With the completion of the Ranger, Surveyor, and Orbiter programs, the job of
automated spacecraft in scouting the way for Apollo was done. Our confidence was high
that few unpleasant surprises would wait our Apollo astronauts on the lunar surface.
The standard now passed from automated machinery to hands of flesh and blood.
<br><br><br>

<b>THE SELECTION OF APOLLO LANDING SITES</b><br><br>

The search for places for astronauts to land began with telescopic
maps and other observations from
the Earth, and Ranger Photos. The
site-selection team considered landing constraints, potentials for 
scientific exploration, and options if a
launch was delayed, which shifted
chosen sites to the west. The team
then designated a group of lunar
areas as targets for Surveyors and
Lunar Orbiters.
<br><br>
From the Orbiters' medium-resolution photos, mosaics were made
and searched for geologic and
topographic features that could
make a landing risky: roughness,
hills, escarpments, craters, boulders,
and steep slopes.
<br><br>
Navigation errors could cause an
Apollo landing module to miss a
target point up to 1.5 miles north
or south and 2.5 miles east or west.
So ellipses were drawn an the
mosaics around possible target
areas. Those ellipses represented
50, 90, and 100 percent dispersion
possibilities. The surfaces within
them were then examined to select
the target points that appeared to
be least hazardous.
<br><br>
Flight-path clearance problems
were considered next. This is illustrated by drawing diverging lines
eastward for 35 miles from the
elliptical areas that otherwise looked
best on the mosaics.

A typical marked mosaic is reproduced above. It is a view of a
region in Mare Tranquillitatis, and

Before it was selected, high-resolution Orbiter Photos were used to

ellipses. In those Photos surface
irregularities as small as 3 feet
could be seen. One such mosaic is
reproduced below.

<br><br>
At last everything was coming together - all those elements that had been
committed piecemeal - the command module in Apollo 7, the first manned flight away
from the bonds of Earth in Apollo 8, the flying of the lunar module with men on
board in Apollo 9, and then Apollo 10, which went to the Moon and did everything
short of landing. It all led up to that hot July morning in 1969, when Apollo's moment
of truth was irreversibly upon us.
<br><br>
Uncounted things had to be done before we reached that moment. Before the
operational phase even began, we had to pass through the conceptualization and 
construction phase, remembering something Jim Webb once said, "The road to the Moon
will be paved by bricks and steel and concrete here on Earth." For Apollo we had to
build Complex 39 at a cost of half a billion dollars, that is, we had to finish Stage
Zero, before we could proceed to Stage One, the flying of the birds.
<br><br>
Complex 39 was to Moon exploration what Palos was to Columbus: the takeoff
point. Man had never attempted any such thing before, and I wonder when he will
again. Everything was outsize - among the impressive statistics about the core of
Complex 39, the Vehicle Assembly Building, were its capacity (nearly twice as big
as the Pentagon) and its height (525 feet, thirty feet short of the Washington Monument's).
<br><br>
During 39's construction phase we were, of course, flying Saturn Is - ten of them - and 
in 1966 three Saturn IBs, all from Pads 34 and 37. Everything - launches and
construction - had to mesh; it was like building a thousand different homes for a
thousand demanding people. It was on the last of these IBs that I made my rookie
appearance as director of launch operations, August 25, 1966. The mission was a
1 hour 23 minute suborbital flight to test the command and service module subsystems
and the heatshield. CM 011 was recovered near Wake Island in good condition; its
shield had withstood the heat of reentry at 19,900 mph.
<br><br>
During the construction phase of Complex 39 (1961-66) I was Apollo Program
Manager at the Cape. The first thing we had to do was decide where to build the
moonport. My boss, Dr. Kurt Debus, and Maj. Gen. Leighton Davis, USAF, were
directed to find a place from which to launch huge vehicles like the projected Nova
or the Saturn V - Cape Canaveral's 17,000 acres weren't nearly large enough. In this
study we considered sites in Hawaii, the California coast, Cumberland Island off
Georgia, Mayaguana Island in the Bahamas, Padre Island off the coast of Texas, and
several others. Eventually we concluded that the most advantageous site was Merritt
Island, right next to the Air Force's Cape Canaveral facilities, which had been launching 
missiles since 1950 and NASA vehicles since 1958. Our report was completed
July 31, 1961, and we spent all night printing it, after which Dr. Debus and I flew up
to Washington and briefed Mr. Webb and Dr. Seamans. So 84,000 acres of sand and
scrub were acquired for NASA by the government, plus 56,000 additional acres of
submerged lands, at a total cost of $71,872,000.
<br><br>
We lost no time in raising the curtain on Stage Zero. No one who was involved
can ever forget the driving urgency that attended Apollo. Nor the dedication of those
who worked on it, including the construction crews, who by 1965 numbered 7000
persons at the Cape.

<br>

At one time we had considered preparing the space vehicle horizontally, and
then erecting it vertically on the pad, but this was simply out of the question for a
360-foot bird. So we had to erect the Saturn V stage by stage, which meant that,
because of rain and wind, we had to have an enclosed building. Even a 10- to 15-knot
wind would have given us trouble while we were erecting outdoors, and higher winds
could prove disastrous. Thus the Vehicle Assembly Building became an enclosed
structure. Should the high bays be strung out four in a row, or built back-to-back?
We decided on the latter format because only two big cranes (250-ton bridge cranes)
would be needed instead of four, and because the box-like structure would better
withstand hurricane winds of 125 mph. The possibility of hurricanes also dictated
that we have two crawlers, one to carry the Mobile Service Structure away from the
pad, and one to bring the Apollo-Saturn V and its Mobile Launcher to shelter in the
VAB. The height of the building was dictated by the hook height, and we started
planning for 465 feet; the final height was 525. Remember that when we started
planning the VAB in 1961 we weren't sure what size bird would roost in this big nest.
We also had to begin design work before we knew whether the trip to the Moon would
involve an Earth-orbit or lunar-orbit rendezvous.
<br><br>
I think of the VAB not as a building but as an intricate machine that assembled
the vehicle in its final phases. People were surprised to learn that the various stages had
never seen each other until they were introduced in the VAB drydock. The first stage
had been built by Boeing at Michoud outside New Orleans, the second stage by North
American at Redondo Beach, Calif., the third by McDonnell Douglas at Huntington
Beach, Calif., and the Instrument Unit by IBM at Huntsville, Ala. The spacecraft that
went on top of this stack were also introduced for the first time in the VAB, the
CSM from the North American plant at Downey, Calif., and the LM from Grumman
in Bethpage, Long Island.
<br><br>
Could these pieces, arriving from all over the country, play together? Every wire
in every plug had to join exactly the right wire, with no electrical interference or
change of signal strength, and a command signal had to work from the Instrument
Unit through the third and second stages into the first. After the various stages had
been put together they had to be checked out as an entity, and once this had been
done you naturally don't want to break the electrical connections again. When the
Instrument Unit orders "Go right", you don't want an engine three stages down to
go left. The pieces not only had to match each other, but also the ground equipment.
Lines for the flow of liquid hydrogen from the ground had to match the stages, and so
did others for the flow of liquid oxygen and still others for gaseous nitrogen and
helium. Television monitors had to be designed and installed so that we could know
what was happening in hundreds of places at any given time - which meant all the
time.

<br>

The skill required of the technicians working within Complex 39 - and throughout
the Kennedy Space Center - had to be fine-honed. One of the legends had it that the
crane operator who set the 88,000-pound second stage on top of the first stage had to
qualify for the job by lowering a similar weight until it touched a raw egg without
cracking the shell. Of the Cape's 26,500 workers - the peak number in 1968 - a high
percentage were men and women who possessed such skills. One can speculate whether
such a crew is likely to be assembled in one place again.
<br><br>
The pads of Complex 39 were abuilding at the same time the VAB rose on its
4225 16-inch steel pipe pilings that had been driven more than 160 feet below the
sandy surface into bedrock. Pad A and Pad B were twins, each occupying about 160
acres; we had also planned a Pad C, which explains why the crawlerway from A to B
has an elbow-like crook in it - the elbow would have led to C. 
(We even had a contingency 
plan for a Pad D in case launchings became more and more frequent.) The
pads were built 8700 feet apart so that an explosion could not wreck more than
one of them. They were located three and one-half miles from the VAB and the
Launch Control Center. In the early days we'd had to control a launch from a site
close to the pad, to avoid electrical problems induced by a longer run of electric
cabling, which in turn meant that we worked from a blockhouse heavily protected
against fire and blast. Now, by the time the Saturns were ready, digital data technology
had advanced to the point where firing rooms could be in a structure miles away.
<br><br>
How to get the Apollo-Saturn V from its birthplace in the VAB to the pad from
which it would fly for the first and only time in its life? Early in the program we
considered moving it on its three and one-half mile journey by water. The barge concept 
was deep in our thinking: the first and second stages had to come to the Cape
from Louisiana and California, respectively, by man's oldest form of transportation,
since they were too large to go through tunnels or under bridges. On this short trip
why not also float the Saturn V and its Mobile Launcher standing upright on a barge?
We got the Navy to run tests at the David Taylor Model Basin in Washington, which
showed that the hydrodynamic requirements of such a topheavy barge would be too
demanding. We looked into a rail system, into pneumatic-tire transporters, and ground
effects machines but all were impractical or too expensive.

Then somebody in our shop came up with the idea of using giant tracked
machines like those used in strip mining. What evolved was the unique crawler or,
more politely, transporter. As built by the Marion Power Shovel Company, the crawler
took shape with eight tracks, each 7 by 41 feet, with cleats like a Sherman tank, except
that each cleat weighed a ton. Mounted over these eight tracks was the platform, bigger
than a baseball diamond, on which the Apollo-Saturn V and its Mobile Launcher
would ride majestically from VAB to pad at one mile per hour. The package weighed
9000 tons, two-thirds cargo, one-third crawler.
<br><br>
If that sounds easy, it wasn't. In July 1965, during a test, some bearings cracked
because we had assumed the weight would be equally distributed on various parts of
the crawler. We were wrong. The bearings, incidentally, were ten inches in diameter
and there were eleven sets of them. This problem was met by changing from roller
bearings to sleeve bearings; we also topped off the crawlerway with eight inches of
Alabama river rock to distribute the load evenly and to relieve friction at the turns.

<h3>KEEPING VERTICAL ON THE MOVE</h3> 

The crawler also required a leveling system that would keep the Saturn V to
within one degree of absolute vertical. The sensing system depended on two 
manometers - each 135 feet long, extending like an X from corner to corner under the
platform; if they showed the deck was out of level 
by even half an inch, it was corrected 
by hydraulically raising or lowering one or more of the corners. Adjustments
were made many times during the trip from the VAB, especially when the crawler
climbed the five-degree incline leading up to the pad.
<br><br>
One of the great days in the history of the Cape was May 25, 1966, when Apollo-Saturn 
500-F-a test vehicle built by Marshall Space Flight Center that duplicated
everything except engines and spacecraft, of which it had none - rolled out of the
VAB on the crawler and moved at glacial speed to Pad A, gleaming in the brilliant
sunshine. It was the biggest rocket ever built by man, dummy though it was, and up
there, safely on the pad, Saturn V was something to behold. It was five years to the
day since President Kennedy had proposed landing a man on the Moon and returning
him safely to Earth. When the crawler put the launcher on its supports that afternoon,
one of the men who (along with me) breathed easier was Don Buchanan, on whose able
shoulders the design responsibility for both the crawler and launcher had been placed
three years before.

Dr. Debus had been wearing two hats, one as director of this growing Center,
the other as director of launch operations. With the pressure mounting he decided to
doff one of them, so two months after the roll-out of 500-F, I was appointed Director
of Launch Operations, an assignment I held until after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins
demonstrated in July 1969 that Apollo was a success.

<br>

In the very early days there had been a lot of hit-and-miss, seat-of-the-pants business 
in launching rockets - and, insofar as the public was concerned, a lot of black
magic. Some odd things happened. I recall a Redstone launch in May 1954, when I was
still in the Army, that we had to delay because somebody reported a fishing skiff
offshore, a dangerous place to be at liftoff time. We sent out some guards to warn the
fishermen out of the way. By the time the guards reached the spot they found the
boat was up on the beach and the fishermen were gone. Then we had to send someone
to find the guards and tell them to come back, and that took another hour before we
could launch. At other times the count would be held up because diesel engines powering 
a tractor didn't work, or a key to the tractor had been lost.
<br><br>
But we learned as we traveled this long road. The really big event was the launch
of the first Saturn V, November 9, 1967, which we designated Apollo 4. To me that
was the real mark; its success meant we were really going to make the Moon landing.
To bring together the massive hardware and the complex ground equipment exactly
when we wanted to was an achievement. You don't look at a thing like the Saturn V
without a lot of humility in your heart. Consider the three stages, the Instrument Unit,
the vast amount of automation, the many computers on the ground and in the stack,
the swing arms, the hold-down arms, the propellant loading system - all these were
intricate and potentially troublesome elements that had to be brought up to speed,
and at a vast launch complex that was being used for the first time.

We kept having problems during the Countdown Demonstration Test in September

go so far, and we'd find a leak. We had ground equipment problems, then procedural
problems; batteries failed, and pressure gauges developed faults. But these problems
melded our team, as in a cauldron. Under pressure our people came of age, in the
firing room and on the pad. When the five engines of Saturn 501 fired up at 7 a.m. we
had confidence, which proved to be justified.

By the time of Apollo 11, the number of printed pages, including interface
control documents, that were required to check out a space vehicle actually surpassed
30,000. We had to make so many copies that a boxcar would have been required to
hold the documents necessary to launch a Saturn V. The more contractors involved,
the greater the need for formality. No more holding up launches for fishing skiffs;
no more offhand decisions such as we sometimes had to make in the early days. The
schedule was always upon us in Apollo. We had to work concurrently on different
launch flows. When Apollo was at its peak 
we had three firing rooms working simultaneously 
in the launch control center, with three crews of 500 apiece manning the
consoles. That took a lot of manpower, and the person I depended on most heavily to
keep the operation moving was Paul Donnelly, an unflappable veteran of Mercury
and Gemini days.

<h3>A LAUNCH EVERY OTHER MONTH</h3> 

The centers - that's what we called intervals - between launches were two months.
That is, Apollo 9 went in March, Apollo 10 in May, and Apollo 11 in July. But each
vehicle took five months from the time its components arrived in the VAB until its
launch. Thus the overlapping.
<br><br>
Look at the situation in early March 1969. Apollo 9 on Pad A was ready for
launch - delayed three days because the astronauts caught colds - and the team of 
500 - engineers and technicians - was working twelve- or thirteen-hour days. 
Apollo 10
was ready to be rolled out of the 456-foot hangar doors of the VAB for two months
of intensive checkout on Pad B. But the components of Apollo 11 had already arrived
and were undergoing tests in the VAB and in the vacuum chambers of the Manned
Spacecraft Operations Building. Apollo 11 would roll out at 12:30 p.m., May 20, one
month and 26 days before it lifted off for the Moon.

a flame deflector coated with a black
ceramic is in place below the opening, while
a yellow (uncoated) spare deflector rests on
its track in the background. It takes a tremendous 
flow of water (28,000 gollons per
minute) to cool the flame deflector and
trench. The pumps, which start 8 seconds
before ignition, can deliver that flow for
30 seconds, and then a reduced flow for
an indefinite period. Another 17,000 gpm
of water curtains the Mobile Launcher
tower from the rising flames.

The pressure on these people was pretty severe. At a launch a person just sat
there glued to his console, watching the needles for any sudden changes, knowing that
he would be committing this big vehicle, with men aboard: a $400 million commitment. 
And it wasn't the money only, or the men. The entire world was watching for
the success of the United States.
<br><br>
We had both to prepare the bird and to make sure our people could detect and
understand any anomaly. I used to walk through the console panel area right up to
about the last 45 minutes before liftoff. I'd be checking on alertness, 
especially among
men who had been working long hours. Were they fatigued? Were they concentrating
on the dials? Was there any unnecessary chit-chat going on?
When we had long holds during the Countdown Demonstration Tests I had to
judge how far we could go, whether we were pushing too hard, whether we had to
call a delay and wait until the next day. The team had to be as well rehearsed as any
ballet, or any football team. You do not get the commitment for launch without a lot
of hard days and weeks and months of practice.

<h3>TESTING THE TEAM</h3> 
 
About eighty percent of the people on these teams worked for the contractors;
the rest were NASA employees. All of them had to go through examinations. We'd
call a man in - say a swing-arm console operator - before a board of three or four
examiners and we'd have his part of the mission simulated on a console. He would
have five minutes to get set, before making split-second decisions. We'd say, "Okay,
here's your console, and here's your condition." The examiners would move a 
red-green slide, or put a yellow light on. The operator would look at 
the simulation on his
console, and say, "Okay, that's green, and it means the pressure is okay; that's red
and it means the pressure is too low." 
Dozens of other simulators would test his proficiency. 
We had to make sure. We had to be able to say "We understand the problems,
we've done the detective work; we've found the solution and we've tested it, and we
have confidence everything will work".

<br>

In our testing we had a building block approach, very logical, very methodical;
you built each test on the last test, and the whole sequence expanded in the process.
Everything culminated in the two main tests, Flight Readiness and Countdown
Demonstration. Flight Readiness would take us through the total flight, including an
abbreviated trip to the Moon, with all the valves working, all the sequences following
according to the logic we had worked out for them. It was a total test of the electrical
system and the software.

</center>
<br>

The Flight Readiness Test was dry (that is, without propellants) but the Countdown 
Demonstration Test (93 hours) was loaded with propellants, including several
thousand tons of cryogenics in the three stages and tons of RP-1 fuel in the first stage.
This one we took right up to the point of 14 seconds before ignition. We had four or
five different ways to stop the countdown sequence at 14 seconds, and I would customarily 
look at Ike Rigell and say "How many stops have we got?". The test had to
be stopped at T minus 14 seconds because if it went down to 9 we would activate the
ignition sequence. So everybody wore a sort of tense smile when it came to 14 seconds.
We never had an accidental ignition, which would have meant chaos. (We did not
have the astronauts in the CM during this part of the CDDT.)
<br><br>
Then we would unload the cryogenic propellants and dry out the tanks, which
took five or six hours, a little longer than it took to load. Next day we would pick up
the count at about three hours and run through the schedule up to simulated lift-off,
now with the astronauts on board. It was important for the flight crew to go through
this final exercise: to suit up in the Manned Spacecraft Operations Building, get in the
vans, ride out to the pad, load into the CM, and check the flight systems.

I have often been asked why it took hundreds of men to launch the astronauts to
the Moon, whereas just two of them on the Moon can launch themselves back to
Moon orbit. Well, the two of them were there on the Moon in the LM's ascent stage.
They had everything they needed: their fuel was loaded; they had water; their cooling
system was working and so was their oxygen supply. Their radar was tracking and
their communications to Earth were functioning, and long before launch we had
checked to see that they had no electrical interference. These systems were working
because of the preparations and check-out efforts of hundreds of people on the ground
before the spacecraft was committed to launch.

 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
 <h3>CHAPTER 6.5</h3>
 <hr><br>
</center>

<h3>WHEN THE RED LIGHT LIT UP</h3> 
  
It was remarkable that every manned Apollo launch lifted off exactly on schedule,
up to the last one. (Apollo 14's forty-minute delay was due to weather.) But Apollo 17,
the only night launch, was delayed 2 hours and 40 minutes, until 12:33 a.m., because
of the failure of an automatic countdown sequencer in the ground equipment. The
way we had the launch set up was that the last three-minute period in effect was a series
of automatic commands, all done by a timer. If you didn't get through a certain gate
in the automatic sequencer the next command would not be given. This protected us
against a faulty liftoff.
<br><br>
This is what the term "terminal sequence" meant, which took a great deal of
check-out time in the months preceding launch. When we got down to 30 seconds
before lift-off, the indication of pressurization for one of the propellants in the S-IVB
stage hadn't registered, so the sequencer stopped the count. The red light on the overhead 
indicator in the firing room lit up. The engineer monitoring that read-out on the
strip chart told us the S-IVB was not pressurized. The ladder in the sequence wasn't
met, so we got a cut-off at 30 seconds.

<br>

The team went through a back-out act, as they had practiced, the arming command 
was withdrawn, the on-board batteries were taken off line, the radio-frequency
transmitters turned off, and within three or four minutes the space vehicle had been
returned to a status where we could safely hold. Everything was done very coolly, very
gingerly. Gene Cernan, the commander of the flight, said later that he kept his
hand - very tightly - on the abort switch, "because you never know". But once again
the launch escape tower went unused.
<br><br>
The problem turned out to be a faulty diode in the terminal sequencer. Among
the hundreds of commands given in sequence, one was not forthcoming, so everything
stopped - which is one of the marvels of Apollo. At this late date in the program
nobody batted an eye, including Walter J. Kapryan, the able engineer who had succeeded 
me as launch director when I went to Washington as Apollo Program Director
three years earlier.

No story about the Cape - Canaveral, then Kennedy, then Canaveral again - would 
be complete without a mention of the visitors. By the time the Apollo program
ended in 1972 we had attracted more than 6 million of them, and that doesn't count
people who lined the roads and watched the lift-offs (there were a million of those, it
was estimated, for Apollo 11). We had VIP visitors in a steady stream - Presidents
of the United States, members of the Supreme Court, members of Congress, almost
any prominent person you could mention.
<br><br>
We had leaders from many countries - I recall the Shah of Iran, King Hussein of
Jordan (he was a jet pilot), the King of Afghanistan, King Baudoin of Belgium, Haile
Selassie of Ethiopia, Chancellor Erhard of Germany, and President Radhakrishnan
of India, who had been a professor of philosophy at Oxford. Other visitors included
foreign ministers and cabinet members from many countries. We talked to most of
them in informal sessions, explaining as best we could the mysteries of spaceflight.
The one visitor who impressed me most came in November 1963, and we briefed
him on a Saturn-Apollo unmanned mission due to fly in January - which would be
the first Saturn I to carry two stages (with a total of 14 engines, still the record for
launch vehicles). He promised to come back for the launch if he possibly could.
But he never made it because he was assassinated in Dallas six days later.

The Mission Operations Control Room was the focal 
point for all the activities of the Mission
Control Center. At any time during an Apollo 
mission, one of the four flight control teams would be
manning these consoles. Each controller in this room 
was supported in his operation by other
people and facilities, both in the staff support 
areas within the building and in the world outside
the Center. Since the completion of the Apollo missions, 
this room and the support areas have

<br><br>
The last Apollo flight to the Moon has been called "the end of the beginning".
It represented more than just the end of a program to me. It brought to a close a phase
of my career. Apollo had become intimately interwoven in the fabric of the waking
hours of my life and often caused the remaining hours to be fewer than they should
have been. My first involvement with the program had occurred at Langley Field, Va.,
11 years before the Apollo 17 flight. During those formative years of the lunar program 
I was faced with the challenge of flying Mercury, and of necessity my commitment 
to Apollo could not assume the proportions it would in later years. Only twenty-three 
days before my first Apollo meeting at North American Aviation, we were flying
Friendship 7 and John Glenn on the country's first manned orbital flight.
<br><br>
In those naive early days I had no idea I would be charged with the responsibility
not only for flight operations but for managing the computer software programs that
would be used for landing two astronauts on the Moon and returning them to Earth.
Although in 1962 we had decided we were going to the Moon, we had yet to figure
out how we were going to get there and return, let alone determine the equipment,
facilities, and personnel we would need. Many difficult hours were yet to be spent in
conference rooms, visiting contractor plants and test sites, and waiting at airports.
I had yet to experience the frightening experience of disarming an angry young man
with a gun on one of many flights to Cape Kennedy. The future held both periods of
despair and frustration and those exciting and satisfying moments when we flew that
were to make it all seem worthwhile. Now, with Apollo 17, it was coming to an end.
I found it difficult to accept the finality of that landing on December 19, 1972, near
the USS <i>Ticonderoga</i> in the Pacific Ocean. The challenge would never again be quite
the same. Apollo was like an intoxicating wine and certainly the last of the vintage.

<h3>VIGILANCE AND JUDGMENT</h3>

"The accomplishments of this last Apollo mission and the successes of the previous
Apollo flights were the result of the dedicated efforts and the sacrifices of thousands of
individuals." I have difficulty recollecting how many times I stood on the platform
at Ellington Air Force Base welcoming the returning flight crews and heard those
words repeated. But they are nevertheless quite true. The people in Houston were with
their astronauts each step of the way. The interchange between Mike Collins, serving
as the CapCom (capsule communicator), and Bill Anders as Apollo 8 orbited the
Moon clearly demonstrated this feeling. Mike called Apollo 8, saying "Milt says we
are in a period of relaxed vigilance". Bill came back with "Very good. We relax; you
be vigilant." They came to rely on the controllers, as they well knew their very lives
depended on their vigilance and judgment. Mike later put it well in his book, Carrying
the Fire. He writes of the Gemini 10 reentry and their reliance on "Super Retro" John
Llewellyn. Mike says that they knew if they made a mistake John would be so angry
that he would stick up his strong Welsh arm and yank them out of the sky. John's
dominant personality is illustrated by the time he was coming on duty for his shift
in the Control Center and, finding his parking space taken, he simply parked on the
walk next to the door rather than waste time looking. Like his compatriots, John was
thoroughly dedicated. His type is at its best when fighting wars or flying missions.
<br><br>
Many individuals were involved in the building and testing of the spacecraft and
its systems, but once given the spacecraft and the necessary facilities and equipment,
the Apollo Operations Team was charged with the awesome responsibility for the
accomplishment of the mission. This team was composed of hundreds of 
individuals - government and contractor personnel, as 
well as representatives of the Department of
Defense and of foreign nations such as Australia and Spain. Each team member had
been carefully selected and subjected to countless hours of training and simulations;
each had also participated in Mercury, Gemini, or Apollo testing and flight operations. 
Time and time again, these young men had to rely on their technical knowledge
to assess the unexpected and determine the right course of action. The "luck" the
Operations Team had in overcoming adversity is exemplified by the words of University 
of Texas football coach Darrell Royal: "Luck is what happens when preparation
meets with opportunity". The luck of the Operations Team was the result of thorough
and careful planning and training and the development of both people and procedures.

Thinking back over the events of the past years, I realize the Operations Team
was always prepared when the opportunity presented itself. I'll certainly always remember 
their performance on Apollo 11. It takes an awful lot of events all going right
to get you to the Moon, let alone return. It was our first attempt at the landing and we
had somehow, incredibly, reached the point where we were starting the descent for the
landing. Thus far, all had gone astonishingly well. The first phase of the firing of the
lunar module engine went well as the descent started; and then, approximately five
minutes after ignition, the first of a series of computer alarms was received via telemetry
in the Mission Control Center and was also displayed to the crew onboard the lunar
module Eagle. I was responsible for the software in that computer, the logic that made
it all work. You can imagine the thoughts racing through my mind: Had we come all
this way for naught? What was wrong? The flight controller responsible for assessing
the problem, 27-year-old Steve Bales, was faced with an immediate decision: Should
we continue the descent or initiate an abort? An abort meant there would be no landing
for Apollo 11: we would have to try again. When Flight Director Gene Kranz pressed
him for his answer, young Mr. Bales' response was the loudest and most emphatic
"go" I have ever heard.
<br><br>
But it wasn't over yet. The lunar module was under automatic control as it
approached the surface. Neil realized that the automatic descent would terminate in
a boulder field surrounding a large rim crater. He took over control of the spacecraft
and steered the Eagle toward a smooth landing site. The low-level fuel light for the
engine came on, indicating about enough fuel for only 116 seconds of firing time on
the engine. With 45 seconds of fuel left, Eagle set down with a jolt and we were there.

I could recall any one of hundreds of incidents that have occurred over the years
as we flew Apollo. Launch has always been an uneasy time for me, and I always
looked forward to successful separation from the booster. When one adds to this an
apprehension caused by bad weather over the Cape, I become even more concerned.
It turned out that all of the elements were present for Apollo 12. The launch was
made into a threatening gray sky with ominous cumulus clouds. Pete Conrad's words
43 seconds after liftoff, electrified everyone in the Control Center: "We had a whole
bunch of buses drop out", followed by "Where are we going?" and "I just lost the
platform." The spacecraft had been struck by lightning. Warning lights were illuminated, 
and the spacecraft guidance system lost its attitude reference.

<br>

The spacecraft was still climbing outbound, accelerating on its way to orbit.
There was not much time to decide what should be done. The crew was given a "go"
for staging and separation from the first stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle, Within
seconds, John Aaron, the CSM electrical and environmental systems engineer, found
what had happened. Pete was asked to switch to the secondary data system so that
telemetry would show the status of the electrical system. The crew was then asked
to reset the fuel cells, which came back on line, and Apollo 12 continued on its way
into orbit. Additional checks were made of the spacecraft electrical system and a
guidance reference was reestablished. Apollo 12 went on to the Moon.
<br><br>
A chapter of this book is devoted to Apollo 13. As I moved up in the organization, 
I reluctantly relinquished the job of flight director. But there were many well
qualified young men to assume this responsibility. My faith in their abilities was
confirmed by their actions during this epic flight. Following the successful return of
the Apollo 13 crew, the performance of the Operations Team was recognized with the
presentation of the Medal of Freedom by the President of the United States to Sig
Sjoberg, my colleague through all the tribulations of Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.
<br><br>
Docking was another major hurdle that had to be overcome if we were to make
it to the Moon. Normally, it went well but I always breathed easier when it was
behind us. There had been no major docking problems in the program until Apollo 14.
After five unsuccessful attempts by Al Shepard and his crew, we still had not made
the initial docking with the lunar module. Previously we'd always had a docking
probe and drogue available in the Control Center, as well as experts on the system,
but now there were frantic calls for assistance and the absent docking system had to
be hurriedly located to help understand what might be going on thousands of miles
out in space. Procedures were worked out and another attempt proved successful.

<h3>REPROGRAMMING IN FLIGHT</h3>

The next Apollo 14 problem occurred just prior to the final descent for landing
at Fra Mauro. An abort command was received by the lunar module's guidance
computer. Had the abort command been initiated, it would have separated the ascent
stage from the descent stage and terminated the landing. The descent had to be delayed;
and, as Al Shepard and Ed Mitchell orbited the Moon, the ground valiantly tried to
determine the cause of the problem. It was isolated to one set of contacts of the abort
switch on the instrument panel. Recycling the switch or tapping on the instrument
panel removed the signal from the computer. A computer program was developed
and verified within two hours by the Operations Team and inserted manually into the
computer, allowing the computer to disregard the abort command. The unexpected
came again within minutes. As the crew started the descent to the Moon, the altitude
and velocity lights of the computer display indicated that the landing radar data were
not valid. This information provided essential updates to the computer. Flight Controller 
Dick Thorson made a call to recycle the landing radar circuit breaker. The
crew complied. The lights were extinguished and the necessary computer entry update
was made at an altitude of about 21,000 feet. Apollo 14 and Al Shepard's and Ed
Mitchell's climb almost to the top of Cone Crater are now history.
<br><br>
There were occasions when the problems that came up did not require an
instant decision but rather resulted in long hours in conference in Mission Control.
For example, on Apollo 15, the flight of Endeavour and Falcon, as the spacecraft
traveled from the Earth to the Moon, the service propulsion system developed a
problem. This is the system that is required to place the spacecraft in orbit around
the Moon and on its trajectory back to Earth. Needless to say, this was a critical system. 
A light had illuminated showing that the engine was firing while it obviously was
off. This had to be caused by a short in the ignition circuitry. Had this circuit been
armed while the short was present, the service propulsion engine would have fired. The
Operations Team, working with Don Arabian, a legend in his own time, and Gary
Johnson, an excellent young electrical engineer, isolated the short to one of two
systems. A test firing was initiated by the crew to verify that the short existed on the
ground side of one of two sets of valves. Procedures were then developed by the ground,
working with the flight crew, and the mission continued.

<h3>LONG-DISTANCE SOLUTIONS</h3>

Apollo 16 had its unique problems and one was a major one of the instantaneous
and serious variety. Just after separation of the CSM from the LM, prior to initiating
final descent for the landing, a maneuver was to be performed by the command and
service module Casper to circularize its orbit around the Moon. Preparations for the
burn went well until a check was made of the secondary yaw gimbals. These gimbals
controlled the direction of thrust in yaw plane for the service propulsion system, a
system that was essential to insuring that the astronauts could get out of lunar orbit.
The gimbals appeared normal until the motor was started and then they exhibited
rapidly diverging oscillations. The two spacecraft were asked to rendezvous; and
Jim McDivitt, the Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager, met with Bob Gilruth and
me to tell us that it appeared to him that the mission would have to be terminated.
<br><br>
Another meeting in an hour was scheduled to review the bidding. By the time we had
the second meeting, the Operations Team, through extensive testing and simulations,
determined that the oscillations would have damped and the secondary servo system
was safe to use. John Young and Charlie Duke proceeded with the landing, as I reflected 
on the phenomenal capabilities of a group of young engineers who had
solved a problem of a spacecraft 240,000 miles away from Earth.
<br><br>
Apollo 17, the final mission to the Moon, clearly demonstrated the maturity of
the Operations Team. For the first time, a manned launch was made at night. A landing 
was made in the valley of Taurus-Littrow, the most difficult of any of the Apollo
landing sites. The spacecraft performed in an outstanding fashion, and there were
no major problems. Minor ones that did occur were handled without difficulty.
The problems encountered were all overcome due to the careful premission
preparation, rigorous testing, planning, training, and hours and hours spent simulating
critical phases of the mission with the flight crew. These simulations prepared the
controllers and the crew to respond to both normal and abnormal situations. Their
record speaks for itself on the adequacy of the training. This was not brought together
overnight, and in 1962 we were a long way from Taurus-Littrow.
<br><br>
The basic flight-control concepts used for Apollo were developed by a small
group of people on the Mercury Operations Team. In 1958, under the leadership of
Robert R. Gilruth, the Space Task Group had been given the fantastic responsibility
of placing a man in orbit around the Earth. Those few young men who assumed this
task did not have any previous experience on which to rely. It had never been done
before. What they did have was the willingness to tackle any job, and a technical
capability that they had attained through an apprenticeship in what I consider to
have been the Nation's finest technical organization, the National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics. Other members of the Mercury Operations Team had experience
with aircraft development and flight testing with the Air Force and Navy or with
major aircraft companies, both within this country and in particular with AVRO of
Canada. That country's cancellation of the CF-105 with its attendant effect on the
AVRO program proved to be a blessing to the United States space program. Many
fine engineers came to work as members of the Space Task Group at Langley. Jim
Chamberlin, John Hodges, Tecwyn Roberts, Dennis Fielder, and Rod Rose, to name
a few. The operational concepts that were developed by this cadre on Mercury were
improved as experience was gained on each flight. As the Operations Team assumed
the responsibility for flying Gemini, the concepts were further developed, expanded,
and improved. There were many essential steps that had to be taken to get to the
Moon. For the Operations Team, Gemini was one.
<br><br>
Only a small group of people were involved in Mercury operations. When the
team was given the responsibility for flying Gemini, and with the Mercury flights
continuing, the organization had to be expanded. A conscious effort was made to
bring young people into the organization. With an abundance of recent college graduates, 
the team took on a young character. The additions brought with them the
aggressiveness, initiative, and ingenuity that one finds in the young engineer. They
did not all come from major colleges; there were graduates of Southwestern State
College in Oklahoma, Willamette University in Oregon, San Diego State College,
Texas Wesleyan College, and Northeastern University in Boston, to name a few. A
large contingent of officers was also made available by the U.S. Air Force and this
group provided excellent support. I came to rely on these young people and I can
honestly say they never let me down.

<h3>AN ADVANCED COMPUTER COMPLEX</h3>

As the team was being built, the facilities and equipment were also being
defined, developed, constructed, and brought on line. The Mercury flights were
directed from a control center at Cape Canaveral, Fla. In 1962, the Space Task
Group moved to Houston to form the Manned Spacecraft Center. The construction
of the Mission Control Center in Houston, designed to accomplish the lunar missions,
was started in 1962. Thirty-six months later it was to be used to control Jim McDivitt's
and Ed White's flight in the Gemini IV spacecraft. Its full capability was not used for
Gemini, however, as much work still had to be accomplished. One of the most
advanced computer complexes in the world had to be integrated with a global tracking 
network. Tracking and telemetry data had to be relayed from stations in Australia,
Spain, the Canary Islands, Guam, Ascension Island, California, Bermuda, Hawaii,
Tananarive, and Corpus Christi. Tracking ships were built to provide additional
communication coverage in ocean areas. Special Apollo Range and Instrumentation 
Aircraft (modified Boeing KC-135 jets) were deployed around the world.

The tracking ship Vanguard was

Earth orbit, As many as five tracking
ships were employed on the early
Apollo missions.
</table>
</center>
<br>

All this was being done concurrently with the evolution of operational concepts.
During the Mercury and Gemini flight programs, teams of flight controllers at the
remote tracking stations were responsible for certain operational duties somewhat
independent of the main Control Center. The advantages of having one centralized
operations team became more apparent, and for Apollo, 
two high-speed 2.4-kilobit-per-second 
data lines connected each remote site to the Mission Control Center in
Houston. This permitted the centralization of the flight control team in Houston.
Provisions were also made to tie into the Control Center, through a communications
network, the best engineering talent available at contractor and government facilities.

By Apollo, with three men in two spacecraft at lunar 
distances, Mission Control had grown.
<br>
An array of specialists manned the consoles during an Apollo mission.
Key numbers above identify the locations of flight controllers. 1 was
the Booster Systems Engineer, responsible 
for the three Saturn stages. 2 was the Retrofire Officer,
keeping continuous track of abort and return-to-Earth options. 3 was
the Flight Dynamics Officer, in charge of monitoring trajectories
and planning major spacecraft maneuvers; he also managed onboard 
propulsion systems. 4 was the Guidance Officer, who watched
over the CSM and LM computers and the abort guidance system. In
the second row, 5 was the Flight Surgeon, keeping an eye on the
condition of the flight crew. At 6 was the Spacecraft Communicator,
an Astronaut and member of the support crew, who sent up the
Flight Director's instructions. (He was usually called CapCom, for
Capsule Communicator, from Mercury days.) 7 concerned CSM and
LM systems, including guidance and navigation hardware; and electrical,
environmental, and communications systems. After Apollo 11, all communications 
systems were consolidated as a separate task. On the
next row in the middle was 8, the Flight Director, the team leader. 9
was the Operations and Procedures Officer, who kept the team - in and
out of the Center - working together in an integrated way. 10 was
the Network Controller, who coordinated the worldwide communications 
links. 11 was the Flight Activities Officer, who kept track of
flight crew activities in relationship to the mission's time line. 12 was
the Public Affairs Officer who served as the radio and TV voice of
Mission Control. 13 was the Director of Flight Operations; 14 the Mission
Director from NASA Headquarters; and 15 the Department of Defense
representative. During activity on the lunar surface an Experiments
Officer manned the console at 1 to direct scientific activities and relay
word from the science team.
</table>
</center>
<br>

As engineers from the Goddard Space Flight Center were intently determining
the requirements for this ground communications network, building and installing
equipment, and laboriously testing and verifying the network's capabilities, engineers
in Houston, led by a young Air Force officer, Pete Clements, and a fine young
engineer, Lynwood Dunseith, were feverishly working to integrate the computer complex 
and Control Center displays with the network. The critical parameters and limits
that had to be monitored in flight needed to be defined; the necessary sensors for
measuring the parameters needed to be incorporated in the design of the spacecraft;
and rules for utilizing the measurements needed to be developed. But it was not only
a question of ensuring that the right measurements were made. Spacecraft and subsystem 
design also had to have the redundancy and the flexibility needed to overcome
failures and contingencies as they arose. And time was relentlessly marching on. Testing of 
the spacecraft revealed new problems, and new techniques and procedures
often had to be developed to avoid potential difticulties in flight. Programs had to be
developed for operating the spacecraft and Control Center computers, and the programs 
had to be verified, tested, and incorporated in the computers. The end of the
decade moved closer each day. The complexity of the spacecraft and launch vehicle
was exceeded only by the complexity of a worldwide ground-control system.

Then came January 27, 1967, and the AS-204 fire, a day I'll never forget. I was
at the console in Houston monitoring the test at the Cape, together with a group of
flight controllers. We thought we had considered every eventuality, and now we were
struck down by an event that did not occur in space but happened during a ground
test. There were no excuses that could be offered but, out of the despair of the fire,
there came a rededication to the successful accomplishment of the goal and an 
intensified effort on the part of every individual.
<br><br>
The Operations Team had many functions not associated with testing and checking 
out the spacecraft and controlling the mission. These functions were nevertheless
essential to success. One was recovery operations. Recovery techniques for the spacecraft 
and the crew had to be worked out in conjunction with the Department of
Defense and the U.S. Navy. Bob Thompson organized and led this effort during
Mercury and Gemini. The organizational team he established provided the same excellent 
recovery support for Apollo as it had for Mercury and Gemini.

<h3>MANEUVER TARGETING</h3>

The team also developed the techniques for flying the spacecraft and controlling
its trajectory. It had the primary responsibility for developing the programs or logic
used in the computers onboard the lunar module and the command and service module
as well as those in the Control Center. Except for rendezvous maneuvers, the Control
Center was the only source of maneuver targeting; that is, determining the exact magnitude, 
direction, and the time for executing each flight maneuver. Bill Tindall, a truly
outstanding engineer, contributed significantly to this effort. Operations were planned
in detail before a flight. Plans were based both on everything working properly and on
the "what if" situations that might occur. The "what if" situations could not be carried 
to the point of actually reducing reliability by introducing confusion or complexity
into the system. This was quite often a fine line to walk. Techniques also had to be
developed for monitoring all essential systems during critical mission phases. The
procedures, the techniques, the personnel, and an organization all had to be defined
and developed, a task of no small magnitude. Each landing demonstrated how well the
task was performed. Apollo 12 was a classic example, with an incredible pinpoint
landing some 600 feet from the Surveyor spacecraft that had previously landed on the
Ocean of Storms.
<br><br>
To conduct operations for the flights, four complete flight-control teams were
organized and used for all Apollo missions. Each team was headed by a flight director;
Gene Kranz, Cliff Charlesworth, Glynn Lunney, Gerry Griffin, Pete Frank, Milt
Windler, Neil Hutchinson, Phil Shaffer, and Chuck Lewis were all assigned this
responsibility during various phases of the program. To simplify the overall training
program, each team was assigned different events or activities. The individuals on
each team could thus devote their full attention and energy to developing proficiency
in accomplishing a few things, as opposed to having to cover an impossible spectrum.

that would be most useful to lunar scientists,
the types of rock specimen they should particularly 
try to sample, and the special problems in
working with their equipment on the general 
terrain they would encounter.

<br>

The team was responsible for developing the mission plans to demonstrate the
capability of the spacecraft, the systems, and the team to land a crew on the Moon.
A series of unmanned developmental flights was planned with well defined objectives
to be demonstrated on each flight. Apollo 7, the first manned flight, occurred in
October 1968, and the first flight to the Moon, Apollo 8, occurred two months later.
Even while Apollo 7 was flying, the Operations Team was performing simulations
and training for the Apollo 8 mission. As Apollo 8 was flying, training and simulations
were being conducted for Apollo 9, the first Earth-orbital flight of the LM and CSM
in March 1969. The next step, Apollo 10 - a dress rehearsal for 
the first landing - was taken in May 1969. On this flight, on the far side of the Moon, 
a fuel cell was lost and taken off line. The team had trained for 
this contingency and reacted accordingly.

<h3>TRAINING CREWS AND CONTROLLERS</h3>

Astronaut training and development of the flight plans and crew procedures were
directed by Deke Slayton. He accomplished these tasks in an outstanding manner.
The training that Deke provided the crews, as well as the training provided the flight
controllers, gave them the capability to react to the unexpected. Quite often it resulted
in unique training devices and equipment. The zero-gravity environment was simulated 
by using a modified KC-135 aircraft that flew parabolas, thus creating 20 to 30
seconds of weightlessness. A neutral buoyancy water tank was also used to simulate the
weightless environment. The unique Lunar Landing Training Vehicle (LLTV) was
developed to train the astronauts in controlling the lunar module during the final
phase of its descent and landing. The test flights of the LLTV, for example, saw the
successful emergency ejection of three pilots - Joe Algranti and Stu Present, research
pilots, and Neil Armstrong, the commander of the first lunar landing mission - because 
of vehicle failures. Bob Gilruth and I both believed that flying this craft was
more hazardous than flying the actual lunar module.

at the Grand Canyon do not resemble lunar rocks in any
way, the trip here was an important step in familiarizing
the astronauts with the basics of geology, so that they
could function well as observers and collectors.

their chest packs. As fate would have it, this pair did 
not have the chance to use their training.
</table>
</center>
<br>

Simulators also had to be developed to provide training for the flight crew in the
operation of the spacecraft. These simulators were tied in with the Mission Control
Center so that an integrated training could be accomplished with the flight controllers.
These simulations allowed the flight crew to train realistically for all phases of the
mission, including the landing itself. Unique display techniques were used with actual
models of each landing site. The models allowed the crew to gain familiarity with the
terrain and recognizable landmarks. Detailed lunar maps that were based primarily
on data provided by the NASA unmanned lunar orbit program were prepared by the
Air Force Information and Charting Service and by the U.S. Geological Survey.
<br><br>
As the system matured after Apollo 11, greater emphasis was placed on scientific
training and on ensuring that the astronauts were prepared to perform scientific experiments 
when they arrived on the Moon. Prominent scientists both from within the
government and from universities throughout the country offered their time and talent
to ensure that the crew and the Operations Team were adequately trained to perform
the demanding scientitic tasks. During the mission, they also participated as members
of the Operations Team. Apollo brought a new aspect to spaceflight as man on the
surface of the Moon worked in conjunction with a science team on Earth that capitalized 
on his observations, judgments, and abilities. They assessed his comments and
evaluations, and modified the science planning and objectives in real time. This was
not accomplished, however, without moments of frustration and anguish during the
early flights, when the acceptability of the spacecraft and its systems was yet to be
proved. During the later lunar missions, the crew and the Operations Team were
working with proven procedures and a proven spacecraft, and the capabilities of the
science organization were effectively integrated in the performance of the missions.

As a means of saying thanks, on March 5, 1973, this group of scientists held a
dinner for a number of the program and operations personnel they had worked with
over the years. The events of that night clearly showed how well this relationship had
developed. As late as 1969, there were very few that would have been brave enough to
predict such a dinner would have ever occurred.

<h3>CONTRIBUTIONS OF FLIGHT SURGEONS</h3>

Chuck Berry and Dick Johnston and their medical personnel also played an
important role as members of the Operations Team. Working with engineering personnel, 
they developed the monitoring techniques used to observe the critical medical
parameters of man in flight. The flight surgeons' judgment and ability to assess the
astronauts' well-being in flight as well as their confidence in the crew's readiness to
undertake each of the missions were very necessary to achieving success. In the
beginning, there were some who doubted man's capability to even exist, let alone work,
in the environment of space. Chuck Berry had no such doubts and worked bard to
alleviate such concerns. I do not believe that we could have gotten to the Moon
without the contributions of the flight surgeons.
<br><br>
The Apollo Operations Team was a unique group brought together to accomplish
a successful landing on the Moon and return to Earth. I do not believe that the dedication 
and the capabilities of these people have ever previously been duplicated, and
I doubt that such a group will ever be brought together again. A great amount of
preparation preceded the actual flying of an Apollo mission. The spacecraft had to be
designed, built, and tested, but the group that actually flew the mission was faced with
an awesome responsibility. President Truman had a sign on his desk in the White
House stating that "The buck stops here". This comment could well be applied to the
Apollo Operations Team. For these young men and women, the Apollo missions
were their finest hour - the truly great adventure of their lives as well as of mine.

Footprints on the plain at Hadley, beneath the 
unearthly Apennines, were made by men who
had walked the long path of astronaut selection 
and training. To be one of the dozen men who
have so far walked the Moon was to have survived 
close screening for physical and mental
excellence, and to have emerged successfully from long, 
intensive, and often competitive training.

On a June day in 1965, following their spectacular Gemini 4 flight, James
McDivitt and Edward White flew up to Washington from Houston with their wives
and children. The helicopter bearing them from Andrews Air Force Base, Md., had no
sooner settled on the White House lawn than Lady Bird Johnson said she wanted them
all to spend the night; babysitters would be provided. The two astronauts heard the
President call them "Christopher Columbuses of the twentieth century", and he pronounced 
the United States now caught up with the Russians.
<br><br>
The two astronauts had a parade. They lunched with Vice President Humphrey
and congressional leaders, and in the evening they went to the State Department for a
reception. Before a packed assemblage of foreign diplomats they showed a 20-minute
movie of their flight, which included the first American walk in space by Ed White.
<br><br>
In strode Lyndon B. Johnson himself, who told McDivitt and White, "I want you
to join our delegation in Paris." Furthermore, the President wanted them to go now,
as soon as they and their wives could pack. He was seething because the Russians had
humbled the Americans at the Paris Air Show, where Yuri Gagarin was standing by
his spacecraft, shaking hands with everybody and passing out Vostok pins. The French
press noted that the lackluster American pavilion was shunned by the crowds.
<br><br>
Patricia McDivitt and Patricia White wailed in unison, "But we have nothing to
wear!" Never mind, said LBJ, Lady Bird and Lynda Bird and Luci have plenty of
clothes. The ladies retired to the White House bedrooms, and the two Pats were duly
outfitted. Long after midnight the Presidential plane took off, bearing as additional
passengers Hubert Humphrey, James Webb, and Charles Mathews, the Gemini program 
manager.
<br><br>
The astronauts made it only in time for the last day and a half of the eleven-day
show, but they gave the Russians some real competition. Wherever they appeared, the
American <i>jumeaux de space</i> were followed by masses 
of Frenchmen. "A partial recovery for the United States" was the Paris 
newspapers' verdict.

Such were the glory days, when to be an astronaut was to be in heaven - if one
could endure the slavery that was the obverse of the coin.
Altogether there were seven groups of astronauts, a total of 73, of whom 43 flew
before the long night settled on manned space flight after the Apollo-Soyuz mission in
July 1975. Twenty-nine of these filled the 33 slots in Apollo, 
with which we are principally concerned here.
<br><br>
What did it take to become an astronaut? Dr. Robert Voas, a psychologist who
was the Mercury astronauts' training director, detailed the required characteristics as
he saw them: intelligence without genius, knowledge without inflexibility, a high degree
of skill without overtraining, fear but not cowardice, bravery without foolhardiness,
self-confidence without egotism, physical fitness without being muscle-bound, a preference 
for participatory over spectator sports, frankness without blabbermouthing, enjoyment 
of life without excess, humor without disproportion, fast reflexes without panic
in a crisis. These ideals were fulfilled to a high degree.

 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
 <h3>CHAPTER 8.2</h3>
 <hr><br>
</center>

<h3>THE STRENUOUS SELECTION PROCESS</h3> 

In December 1958, plans had been made to post civil service notices inviting applications 
for astronaut service, GS-12 to GS-15, salary $8,330 to $12,770. President
Eisenhower thought this ridiculous, and decided that the rolls of military test pilots
would furnish all the astronauts necessary. "It was one of the best decisions he ever
made", said Robert Gilruth sixteen years later. "It ruled out the matadors, mountain
climbers, scuba divers, and race drivers and gave us stable guys who had already been
screened for security." From the records of 508 test pilots, 110 were found to meet the
minimum standards (including the height and age limitations, 5 feet 11 inches and
40 years).
<br><br>
After further examination, the 110 were narrowed to 69, then to 32, who were put
through strenuous physical tests: How much heat could the man stand? How much
noise? How many balloons could he blow up before he collapsed? How long could he
keep his feet in ice water? How long could he run on a treadmill?
<br><br>
Worst of all, the astronauts thought, were the 25 psychological tests that entailed
minute and painful self-examination ("Write 20 answers to the question: 'Who am I?'")
From the 18 survivors, seven were chosen in April 1959, and they would remain the
Nation's only astronauts for three and one-half years. Their IQs ranged from 130 to
145, with a mean of 136. Even before they had accomplished anything they became
instant heroes to small boys and other hero-worshipers around the world.
<br><br>
Among those who flunked the first round were James Lovell and Charles Conrad,
who were picked up in the Second Nine in 1962 and went on to make four spaceflights
apiece - a record they shared only with John Young and Tom Stafford. The Second
Nine proved even more stable than their predecessors. Excepting Ed White, killed in
the spacecraft fire of January 1967, and Elliott See, who died in a plane crash, all
commanded Apollo flights.
<br><br>
The Second Nine were test pilots, too, but two of them were civilians: Neil Armstrong, 
who had flown the X-15 for NASA, and See a General Electric flier. By the
time the third group of fourteen was selected in 1963 the test-pilot requirement had
been dropped - as had most of the outlandish physical tests - but the educational level
had risen to an averacye of 5.6 years of college, even though the 10 average fell a couple
of points below the first two groups. Four of the fourteen would die in accidents without 
making a spaceflight.
<br><br>
The fourth group of six men wasn't even required to be pilots because they were
scientists (doctors of geology, medicine, physics, and electrical engineering) who, after
selection, had to take an extra year to learn to fly. Because three missions were cut
from the program, only one, Harrison Schmitt, was to fly in Apollo. Three others flew
in Skylab.
<br><br>
The fifth group was the biggest of all, nineteen pilots, of whom twelve would fly
in Apollo, three in Skylab, and one in Apollo-Soyuz. The sixth group, eleven more
scientists, scored the highest mean IQ, 141, but they came too late to fly and six
resigned before 1975. The final group of seven transferred from the Air Force's defunct
Manned Orbital Laboratory in 1969 and their hope had to rest on the resumption of
flight with the Space Shuttle about 1979.
<br><br>
One thing all astronauts had in common: hard work. Each astronaut was assigned
one or more specialties, which he had to learn with dizzying completeness. Neil Armstrong, 
for example, was assigned trainers and simulators, John Young environmental
control systems and personal and survival equipment, Frank Borman boosters. In the
third group Buzz Aldrin, who had earned a doctorate with a dissertation on orbital
rendezvous, was a natural for mission planning; Bill Anders, who had a master's degree
in nuclear engineering, drew the environmental control system; Mike Collins had the
spacesuit and extravehicular activity. The astronauts worked with and learned from
scientists and engineers, and suggested many ideas from a crewman's viewpoint.

<h3>PREPARING FOR ALL EVENTUALITIES</h3> 

Training was the name of the game, and they trained until it seemed the labors of
Hercules were child's play - how to make a tent out of your parachute in case you came
down in a desert; how to kill and eat a snake in the jungles of Panama; how to negotiate 
volcanic lava in Hawaii. An Air Force C-135 flew endless parabolas so the
astronauts could have repeated half-minute doses of weightlessness. They wore weights
in huge water tanks in Houston and in Huntsville to get a feel of movement in zero and
one-sixth gravity.

"The great train wreck" was John
Young's description of the contraption
beyond the console. At the top of the
stairs was a compartment that exactly
duplicated a command module control
area, with all switches and equipment.
Astronauts spent countless hours lying
on their backs in the CM simulator in
Houston. Panel lights came on and off,
gauges registered consumables, and
navigational data were displayed. Movie
screens replaced the spacecraft windows
and reflected whatever the computer
was thinking as a result of the combined
input from the console outside and
astronaut responses. Here the astronauts 
practiced spacecraft rendezvous,
star alignment, and stabilizing a tumbling spacecraft. 
The thousands of hours
of training in this collection of curiously
angled cubicles paid off. Many of the
problems that showed up in flight had
already been considered and it was
then merely a matter of keying in the
proper responses. At left (below), Charles Conrad 
and Alan Bean in the LM simulator
at Cape Kennedy prepare to cope with
any possible malfunctions that the controllers at the console outside could
think up to test their familiarity with
the spacecraft and its systems.

Hair-raising was the device called the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle, a sort of
flying bedstead, which had a downward-pointing jet engine, gimbal-mounted and
computer-controlled to eliminate five-sixths 
of gravity. In addition, it had attitude-controlling 
thrusters to simulate the way the LM would act before touchdown on the
Moon. If the trainer ran out of fuel at altitude, or if it malfunctioned, the
Apollo commander - for he was the only one who had to fly the thing - had to
eject, which meant he was catapulted several hundred feet into the air before his
parachute opened. That was exactly what happened to Neil Armstrong a few months
before his Apollo 11 mission, when his bedstead started to tilt awry a hundred feet
above the ground. Armstrong shot into the air, then floated to safety; the machine
crashed and burned.
<br><br>
Dozens of training aids sharpened astronaut skills, but the most indispensable were
flight simulators, contraptions built around copies of CM and LM control areas and
complete to every last switch and warning light. Astronauts on prime status for the next
mission would climb in to flip switches and work controls. The simulator would be
linked to a computer programmed to give them practice too. What made it exciting
was that training supervisors could also get in the loop to introduce sneaky malfunctions, 
full-bore emergencies, or imminent catastrophes to check on how fast and well
the crews and their controllers would cope. Surrounding the mockup spacecraft were
huge boxes for automatic movie and TV display of what astronauts would see in
flight: Earth, Moon, stars, another spacecraft coming in for docking. When John
Young first encountered a simulator he exclaimed "the great train wreck!". Hour
after weary hour the spacemen had to solve whatever problems the training crews
thought up and fed into the computer. The Apollo 11 crew calculated they spent 2000
hours in simulators between their selection in January and their flight in July 1969.

lunar gravity.

Preparing for the unknown was a challenge. How much work could be done by
a man within a pressurized (and hence
stiff-jointed) spacesuit? What effect would
the lesser lunar gravity have on his efforts?
This truck-borne hoist, adjusted to take out
five-sixths of his weight, gave preliminary
indications. It also previewed the loping
and kangaroo-hopping gaits that would
occur on the Moon. A different way to
simulate lunar gravity was also tried out;
see the rig <a href="ch-8-7.html#trolley">here</a>.
</table>
</center>
<br>

Some of this bone-cracking training was done in Houston but much of it at the
Cape, in Downey, Calif. (the CM), or Bethpage, Long Island (the LM). When the
astronauts were not training they were flying in their two-seater T-38 planes from one
place to the other, or doing aerobatics to sharpen their edge, or simply to unwind. 
Their long absences proved a plague on their home lives, and there was hardly a man among
them who did not consider quitting the program at one time or another "to spend
some time with my family".

<h3>THEIR ORIGINS AND CHARACTERISTICS</h3> 

The 29 Apollo astronauts tended to originate in the American heartland, in
such places as Weatherford, Okla.; Columbus, Ohio; Jackson, Mich.; and St. Francis,
Kans. Four states gave birth to three astronauts each: Texas, Ohio, New Jersey, and
Illinois. Only one astronaut was born in New England, and none in New York City;
only two in the Deep South and two on the West Coast. Birthplaces in the twentieth
century can be deceptive, however: Frank Borman was born in a steel-mill town,
Gary, Ind., but because he was a sickly child (sinus problems and mastoiditis) his
family moved to Arizona; John Young first saw light in San Francisco, but his accent
was authentic grits and red-eye because he grew up in Orlando and rural Georgia and
attended Georgia Tech (where he stood second in engineering). Two were born overseas 
of U.S. families, Anders in Hong Kong and Collins in Rome.

The service schools educated nearly half the Apollo astronauts: the U.S. Naval
Academy eight, West Point five. As might be expected of superachievers they were
good students, the median class-standing pegged at the top sixteen percent. Only two
other colleges produced more than one Apollonian: the University of Colorado and
Purdue with two apiece. Three of the twenty-nine earned doctorates: Aldrin and
Mitchell at MIT, Schmitt, the only one with no military experience, at Harvard. (Pete
Conrad was the lone Astronaut to do his undergraduate work at an Ivy League institution, 
Princeton.)

Coming down easy on an unknown surface with limited fuel
would take great piloting skill. This giant gantry at the Langley

The average Apollo Astronaut was medium-sized, slightly under 5 ft 10 in.,
about 160 pounds. He was 38.6 years old when he made his flight or, in the case of
the four who flew two Apollo missions, his first one. The blue-eyed outnumbered the
brown, 16 to 8, and five had eyes described as hazel or green. Nineteen had (or had
had) brown hair, seven blond, one black, and there were two redheads, Schweickart
and Roosa. Six of them were well over on the bald side, 
Stafford almost at the peeled-egg stage.
<br><br>
The twenty-seven who were married (Swigert and Schmitt were not) produced
an average of 2.8 children. Generally the astronauts - twenty-three Protestants and
six Catholics - adhered more closely to formal religion than their contemporaries; a
high proportion of them served as elders, stewards, deacons, or vestrymen. 
Presbyterian 
Aldrin administered holy communion to himself inside Eagle after it landed on
the Moon, and when Frank Borman was orbiting the Moon he apologized to his fellow
members of St. Christopher's Episcopal Church because his absence made it impossible 
for him to serve as a lay reader on Christmas Eve. The prayer he did say reached
a somewhat larger audience and caused an atheist to sue NASA, unsuccessfully, on a
separation-of-state-and-church issue.
<br><br>
The astronauts were big on sports and flashy cars, but weak in the classics. Mike
Collins, who combined the fastest game of handball (nobody could even come close
to beating him) with a taste for literature, used to say that the space program needed
more English majors to get away from the engineerese in the exhaustive checklists.
He proved his versatility by writing a literate, perceptive, and witty book called
<i>Carrying the Fire</i>.

 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
 <h3>CHAPTER 8.5</h3>
 <hr><br>
</center>

<h3>ADVANTAGES OF BEING THE ELDEST SON</h3> 

Let us proceed to the anomalies, space jargon for the surprises. Who would have
imagined that seven of these superboys-next-door would turn out to be left-handed
(over twice what the percentages would predict), particularly since it is more convenient 
for test pilots to be right-handed? Was it another symptom of the determination
to beat the odds? Similarly, nine of the twenty-nine didn't make it the first time they
applied for admission (two of them had to apply three times). Was it the 
"I'll show 'em" obsession that prompted them to try again - and win?
<br><br>
Then there is the eldest-son syndrome. As long ago as 1874 a psychologist noted
that the first child in a family tended to excel. He got a headstart: his doting parents
taught him to read early, to study hard, to take on responsibility for himself. A survey
of the twenty-nine confirms this thesis to an astonishing degree. Twenty-two were
first-born (six of them in the only-child category). Five others had older sisters but
were eldest sons. Only two, Stuart Roosa and Mike Collins, had older brothers, and
in the case of Collins there is a qualification: he hardly knew his brother, who was
thirteen years older, and Major General and Mrs. Collins gave Mike the only-son
treatment the second time around.
<br><br>
To be dubbed astronaut, by way of the thrilling telephone call from Deke
Slayton or, in some cases, his deputy Al Shepard, was to achieve knighthood. This
occasion the chosen one never forgot, like the day he got married or the day JFK
was shot.

The Flying Bedstead, officially the Lunar Landing 
Training Vehicle, made everyone a bit tense.
(The picture below shows Al Shepard beginning a run.) Its
jet engine and thrusters gave an excellent feel
for landing the LM, but it was cranky, unforgiving, 
and uncontrollable if allowed to tilt toomuch.
</table>
<br>
<table border=0><tr><td>
<img src="i8-7b.jpg" ALT="A photo of astronaut,Shepard beginning a test run on the Flying Bedstead">
</table>
</center>
<br>

Soon he learned that this was only the beginning. An astronaut didn't join the
peerage until he got assigned to a flight, initially to a back-up crew and then later
prime. "I would have flown alone, or with a kangaroo - I just wanted to fly", Mike
Collins wrote.
<br><br>
Men assigned to a crew not only were in the public eye. They and their families
achieved status with their peers; they went to the head of the line when it came to time
in the simulators, or in access to the T-38 planes.
<br><br>
The men with missions got invited to the White House; Congress welcomed
them. Even as late as Apollo 13, whose crew appeared before the Senate Space Committee, 
Senator Curtis credited the astronauts with the ability "to increase the attendance 
of this committee more than anything I know of." Senator Symington observed
that Lovell & Co. represented "all the best in this country", and Senator Margaret
Chase Smith of Maine said that "this is certainly one of the most momentous occasions
of my career".

If the bedstead went flooey, it was time to
leave. Here research pilot Stuart Present ejects,
to parachute to safety. In all, two research
pilots and Neil Armstrong had to bail out. But
when NASA brass suggested dropping the risky
trainer, astronauts who'd already made Moon
landings vetoed it, insisting it accurately forecast
LM handling.
</table>
</center>
<br>

Sometimes fate played a hand, as in the case of Buzz Aldrin. Deep in despair over
his failure to be assigned to a prime Gemini crew - he was back-up on Gemini 10,
and there would be no Gemini 13 - Aldrin was suddenly catapulted to the last mission
because his next-door neighbor Charles Bassett was killed in a plane crash. From his
superb walk in space on his Gemini mission Aldrin went on to back up Apollo 8,
succeeded to prime on Apollo 11, and assured himself a front seat in the history books.
<br><br>
Spaceflight was the <i>sine qua non</i>, but ironically the man who sat atop this bastion
of power was an unflown astronaut. Donald K. Slayton, a dairy farmer's son from
Sparta, Wis., got his wings at age 19 and flew 56 B-25 missions in the Mediterranean
theater before he was 21, followed by seven missions in the Pacific. After World
War II he went to the University of Minnesota (aeronautical engineering) and became
an Air Force test pilot.
<br><br>
A blue-eyed, steel-nerved flier, he was a natural for the second orbital Mercury
mission, after John Glenn's. But doctors discovered he had a slightly irregular heartbeat, 
which raised an issue that assumed vast proportions - his six colleagues even
appealed to President Kennedy to overrule the faction of doctors who wanted to
ground Deke. Kennedy assigned this hot potato to his Vice President, who invited the
astronauts, along with Robert Gilruth, to a weekend at the LBJ Ranch to thrash out
this complaint and others. Deke remained grounded but his comrades elected him their
leader, thereby conferring on him (with Gilruth's concurrence) immense power that
would control the destinies of all astronauts for the next decade.

<h3>WHICH MEN FOR WHICH FLIGHT CREWS?</h3> 

How did Deke select the men to fly? Mostly by seniority. An astronaut stood in
line until his turn came, though the order of assignment within his own group was
important. "They are a durn good bunch of guys, real fine troops, a bunch of
chargers", said Slayton in 1972. "It's not the kind of organization where you have to
keep pointing people in the right direction and kicking them to get them to go. Everybody 
would like to fly every mission, but that's impossible, of course. They all understand 
that, even if it makes some of them unhappy." Slayton was rarely accused of
unfairness, a remarkable achievement considering the stakes involved; his own eventual 
assignment at age 48 to the Apollo-Soyuz mission was universally popular.

calculator. Here Astronauts Scott and Irwin

Not all astronauts were equal, of course. Before the first manned Apollo flights
six crews had been formed, commanded by Schirra, Borman, McDivitt, Stafford,
Armstrong, and Conrad, who had shaken down as the natural leaders with appropriate
seniority. Before he flew Apollo 7 Schirra announced he was quitting afterward, and
that left five. Which one would land first on the Moon? It depended on the luck of
the draw. "All the crews were essentially equal", said Slayton, "and we had confidence
that any one of them could have done that first job."
<br><br>
Either Borman or McDivitt seemed likeliest to be first on the Moon; after they
flew their early Gemini missions they were sent straight to Apollo instead of being
recycled into later Gemini flights. But in 1968 two things happened to derail this
prospect: McDivitt, scheduled to lift off on the first Saturn V (Apollo 8), declined the
opportunity because it would not carry the LM, on which he had practiced so long.
Borman, scheduled for Apollo 9, was "highly enthusiastic" about Apollo 8, LM or no
LM, but in deference to wife and children he decided that this would be his last flight.

It's a long way down. The astronauts had to
train for the possibility that during countdown
their launch vehicle could turn into a bomb. The
rig shown here was practice for a ride for life
from the 320 ft level of the Mobile Launcher.

and zoom down the guide wire into an underground, 
padded and insulated room, safe from
explosion. Astronaut Roosa prepares to climb

Getting in and out of the hatch: a necessary
element in training. Before launch, an astronaut
had to fit into a very cramped space without
rearranging preset console switches. During return 
from the Moon, it was also necessary for
one man to get out and return through the CM
hatch to retrieve the film and data cassettes from
the service module.
</table>
</center>
<br>

Borman's back-up was Armstrong; McDivitt's was Conrad. In each case, the
back-up shifted with the prime, so Armstrong in the normal rotation became
Apollo 11, and Conrad lost his chance to be first man on the Moon by becoming
Apollo 12. There was also the possibility that Apollo 10 (Stafford) might be the first
Moon lander - George Mueller initially saw no point in going to the Moon a second
time without touching down. But for this one the LM wasn't completely adapted for
the task (it weighed too much) and the program management decided they were not
ready for the big step. When the batting order was aligned in the summer of 1968,
nobody could have forecast how the assignments would sort out.

 <h3>CHAPTER 8.7</h3>
 <hr><br>
</center>

<h3>CHOOSING THE FIRST MAN ON THE MOON</h3> 

Once it was fairly certain that Apollo 11 was it, newspaper reporters and some
NASA officials predicted that Aldrin would be the first man to step on the Moon.
The logic was that in Gemini the man in the right-hand seat had done the EVA, and
the early time line drawn up in MSC's lower engineering echelons showed him dismounting 
first. But the LM's hatch opened on the opposite side. For Aldrin to get out
first it would have been necessary for one bulky-suited, back-packed astronaut to climb
over another. When that movement was tried, it damaged the LM mockup. "Secondly,
just on a pure protocol basis", said Slayton, "I figured the commander ought to be
the first guy out ... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed
that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision." Did Armstrong pull his rank, as was widely
assumed? Absolutely not, said Slayton. "I was never asked my opinion", said Armstrong. 
"It was fine with me if it was to be Neil", Aldrin wrote, half-convincingly.
<br><br>
Five days before he sent McDivitt and White on that 1965 midnight ride to
Paris, Lyndon B. Johnson had thrown a monkey wrench into the Pentagon's machinery
by jubilantly announcing that he was promoting those astronauts, both Air Force
officers, from major to lieutenant colonel (he didn't bother to find out that both had
only recently made major). The astronauts were naturally delighted.
<br><br>

A constant companion to an Astronaut during
his training was the graceful twin-engined T-38,
a two-seat jet that was fine for aerobatics.
T-38's were handy for the incessant travel - to
California, New York, the Cape, and way stations - that 
was called for by the policy of
involving astronauts in spacecraft development.
And to men who had in the main been expert
test pilots, the agile T-38 was both a means of
keeping sharp and a resource offering privacy
and pleasure.</table>

Mike Collins, left, lands after an exhilarating
session of aerobatics. The T-38 was useful not
just as a means of keeping piloting skills fine-honed 
but also to keep up g-load tolerances
and inner-ear response to weightlessness. Plenty
of flight hours before launch seemed to reduce
the tendency toward nausea during initial exposure 
to weightlessness during spaceflight.
</table>
</center>
<br>

In justice to Maj. Virgil Grissom USAF and Lt. Comdr. John Young USN, who
had flown Gemini 3 three months earlier, the President accelerated promotions for
them, too, again without saying anything to NASA or the Defense Department. He also
went back and picked up some unpromoted Mercury astronauts. Admiral W. Fred
Boone, NASA's liaison officer to the Pentagon, noting "some dissatisfaction both
among the astronaut community and in the Pentagon", undertook a study. Wrote
Boone: "We agreed it would be preferable that meritorious promotions be awarded
in accordance with established policy rather than on a 'spur of the moment' basis."
<br><br>
The upshot was a policy, approved by the President, providing that each military
astronaut be promoted after his first successful flight, but not beyond colonel USAF
or captain USN. Civilians would be rewarded by step increase in civil service grade.
Only one promotion to any individual.
<br><br>
That policy came unstuck on Apollo 12, flown by three Navy commanders,
Pete Conrad, Dick Gordon, and Alan Bean. Conrad and Bean, having been upped
from lieutenant commander to commander after their Gemini 11 flight, were ineligible
for another promotion. Rookie Bean was. But should Bean be promoted over the
heads of his seniors? Hang the policy, said President Nixon, promoting all three.

Of all the amenities accruing to astronauts, the hard cash came from "the <i>Life</i>
contract". Between 1959 and 1963 Life magazine paid the Seven Original astronauts
a total of $500,000 for "personal" stories - concerning themselves and their 
families - as opposed to "official" accounts of their astronautical 
duties. This arrangement 
increased the astronauts' military income by about 200 percent. It also simplified NASA
public relations, since the famous young men's bylines would be concentrated in one
place and the contract called for NASA approval of whatever they said.
<br><br>
There were drawbacks. The rest of the press took a sour view of what it considered 
public property being put up for exclusive sale (the dividing line between
"personal" and "official" was wafer-thin). Since the same ghostwriters put their
stories in print, the astronauts (and their families) all seemed shaped in the same
mold, utterly homogenized for the greater glory of home, motherhood, and the space
program. "To read it was to believe we were the most simon-pure guys there had
ever been", wrote Buzz Aldrin in <i>Return to Earth</i>. "The contract almost guaranteed
peaches and cream, full-color spreads glittering with harmless inanities", was the way
Mike Collins's book had it.

<h3>WHAT HAPPENS TO EX-ASTRONAUTS?</h3> 

The exclusive-story gambit almost ended when the Kennedy Administration took
over, and Kennedy's press secretary actually announced there would be no more
contracts after Mercury ended. But John Glenn went sailing with the President one
summer day in 1962 and enumerated the costs and risks that came with fame. The
President relented and more contracts were signed after the Second Nine entered, this
time with not only <i>Life</i> but also Field Enterprises. But as more astronauts were
selected, the pie sliced thinner until finally each astronaut was receiving only $3000
per year for his literary output. One last surge came with <i>Life</i>'s European syndication
of the stories of Apollo 8 through 11 in 1969, which brought about $16,000 for each
of sixty astronauts and widows.

program of what-ifs. If

spacecraft parachutes.

<br>

A principal advantage of the contracts was the insurance, $50,000 worth from
both <i>Life</i> and Field for each astronaut, and the widows of the accident victims were
left with nest eggs. Congress might have been able to provide extra income and extra
insurance, but the Vietnam War got in the way, and who was to say a man dying in
space was more deserving than one who stepped on a land mine in a jungle path?
<br><br>
Unfortunately, this easy money led, directly or indirectly, to money acquired less
scrupulously when the Apollo 15 astronauts sold 400 unauthorized covers to a German
dealer in exchange for $8000 each (the dealer got $150,000). The three returned
the money, and were subsequently reprimanded. It also turned out that each of fifteen
astronauts had sold 500 copies of his signature on blocks of stamps for $5 apiece,
without saying anything to bosses Slayton and Shepard about it (five of the fifteen
gave the proceeds to charity). Deke and Al were incensed, but threw up their hands.
If a man has a claim to owning anything, it is his own signature. Nevertheless NASA
put a stop to this business and also placed heavy restrictions on what astronauts
could and could not carry into space.
<br><br>
Homogeneous the astronauts never were. Frank Borman learned to fly a plane
before he was old enough to get a driver's license, and so did Neil Armstrong, but at
the same age Dick Gordon was considering the priesthood, Mike Collins was more
interested in "girls, football, and chess" than in planes, and Jim Irwin had never flown
until he rode a commercial aircraft to begin flight training.
<br><br>
John Glenn went into politics and, after several disappointments, was elected
U.S. Senator from Ohio on the Democratic ticket in 1974. Alan Shepard's $125,000
from the <i>Life</i> and Field contracts became the egg that hatched a fortune in real estate.
Borman, success-prone as always, spent a semester at Harvard Business School, went
to work for Eastern Airlines, and became its president. For several years Donn Eisele
served as director of the Peace Corps in Thailand, which was as different from Dick
Gordon's executive job with the New Orleans Saints football team as was Mike Collins's
directorship of the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum. Armstrong
became a professor of engineering at the University of Cincinnati, Ed Mitchell
founded an organization devoted to extrasensory perception, and Jim Irwin became a
fundamentalist evangelist. Jim McDivitt became an executive of Consumers Power
Company in his home town, Jackson, Mich., and Jim Lovell stayed put with the 
Bay-Houston Towing Company.

Once in awhile some them still turned up on television or radio: Schirra plugging
the railroads, Aldrin Volkswagens, Armstrong and Carpenter banks, and Lovell insurance. 
Collins was offered $50,000 to advertise a beer but he turned it down, "although
I like beer". Lest he appear too upright, Collins did confess that he once made an
unpaid commercial for U.S. Savings Bonds, although he had never seen one in his life.
<br><br>
If the astronauts sometimes dwelt in an aura of public misconception, they
nonetheless performed dazzling feats with skill and finesse. You may search the
pages of history in vain for deeds to match theirs, and many years will pass before
similar feats occur again. All hail, then, to these daring young men who married
technique to valor and in barely a decade transformed the impossible into the
commonplace.

<h3>Protecting Men for Their Steps on the Moon</h3> 

The lunar environment is hostile to man. It lacks
oxygen and water; it is too hot in the day's sunshine (250 F) 
and too cold in the night's darkness (-250 F). 
Hazardous micrometeoroids and
space radiation dart about. With no atmosphere
and therefore no atmospheric pressure, fluids
in an exposed human body will boil on the Moon.
How can man survive, much less operate, in such
an unfriendly environment? Answer: by taking
his own friendly environment with him in the
form of a spacesuit.
<br><br>

<br>
The spacesuit, or Extravehicular Mobility Unit
(EMU), shown above, is actually three
suits in one. These three may roughly be described 
as: a union suit, a diver's suit, and a
suit of armor. Each is custom-tailored to an astronaut's 
dimensions. Precise models of astronaut's
hands, for example, shown below, were
used to prepare fitted gloves.

linked to the vital backpack portable life support
system (PLSS) where the water and oxygen are
stored and metered for precise circulation. The
cooling is necessary because body heat cannot
dissipate adequately.
<br><br>
Over this liquid cooling garment the Astronaut
wears the pressure garment assembly, a kind of
super-sophisticated diver's suit. Constructed of
rubbers and fabrics, and with cleverly contrived
joints, this assembly retains the oxygen atmosphere 
without leakage while facilitating movement. 
It too is linked into the PLSS, where carbon
dioxide and other contaminants are removed
from the oxygen stream. A chest-mounted remote
control unit permits the astronaut to adjust oxygen 
flow and cooling temperature to match his
preferences. The PLSS will sustain activity for up
to 8 hours before its oxygen, water, and battery
power must be recharged. A separate oxygen
system, atop the PLSS, is available for emergencies; 
up to 75 minutes' worth of oxygen is available, 
depending on the draw-off rate.
<br><br>
Protecting the integrity of the pressure garment 
is the outer suit of armor, a 13-layer composite 
more like a coat of mail than the rigid
clanking uniform of castle-haunting ghosts. The
various layers of the outer garment protect the
knight of Apollo from the slings and arrows of
outer space: micrometeoroids, ultraviolet rays,
and other radiation. Visors and shades similarly
protect the eyes.
<br><br>
All suited up the astronaut is not unlike the
small boy who has been so bundled up that he
can hardly move, much less frolic in the snow.
Actually, given all the constraints and requirements, 
spacesuit designers were highly successful
in affording the astronaut extensive mobility in
his EMU. Nevertheless, like the knights of old,
squires are needed to assist suited astronauts in
mounting their steeds and once aboard their
spacecraft the astronauts help each other in donning 
and doffing their outfits. Going to the bathroom, 
as one would imagine, would be nigh
impossible in such garb. So designers built in a
sheath urinal and collector bag. Aside from specially 
absorbent underwear, there was no provision 
for bowel movements during EVA. (Within
the spacecraft, these were coped with by sealable 
disposable bags.)
<br><br>
A compressed food bar for the astronaut to
nibbie on is positioned inside the helmet, as is
a straw-like tube for sipping a beverage from a
neck-ring suspended bag. Close to the mouth also
are voice-actuated microphone pick-ups, which
are an integral part of a skull cap worn under
the helmet. A backpack-housed communications
system enables the astronaut out on the airless
Moon to converse with his colleagues in the
spacecraft and in Mission Control. The latter also
receive, through the PLSS, telemetered biomedical 
data picked up from sensors on the astronaut.
<br><br>
Astronauts actually had a wardrobe of suits,
each oppropriately designed for use in training,
flight, surface and free-space EVA, and as backup. 
Expensive, sartorial splendor was not one of
the suit's design criteria; survival plus the abilities
to communicate, move about, and deal with
equipment were.

<h2>The Shakedown Cruises</h2>

Lifeless and slowly tumbling, the S-IB stage that put Apollo 7
in orbit gave Astronauts Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham man's
first ride atop a load of liquid hydrogen. Now the spent 59-foot
stage served as a passive target for practice in rendezvous,
with one run starting from a distance of 80 miles.
</table>

<br><br>
Consider the mood of America as it approached the end of 1968, by any
accounting one of the unhappiest years of the twentieth century. It was a year of
riots, burning cities, sickening assassinations, universities forced 
to close their doors.
In Southeast Asia the twelve-month toll of American dead rose 50 percent, to 15,000,
and the cost of the war topped $25 billion. By mid-December the country's despair
was reflected in the Associated Press's nationwide poll of editors, who chose as the
two top stories of 1968 the slayings of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King;
Time magazine picked a generic symbol, "The Dissenter", as its Man of the Year.
The poll and the Man were scheduled for year-end publication.
<br><br>
This condition was changed dramatically during the waning days of the year,
figuratively with two out in the last half 
of the ninth, and that is what this chapter is about.
<br><br>
Nineteen sixty-seven, which began as a bad year for the space program, had had
its own sensational upturn with the first flight, unmanned, of the giant Saturn, on
November 9 - a landmark on the path to the Moon. Then 1968 started fairly well
with Apollo 5, the first flight of the lunar module on January 22, which proved the
structural integrity and operating characteristics of the Moon lander, despite overly
conservative computer programming that caused the descent propulsion system to
shut off too soon.
<br><br>
The second unmanned Saturn V mission, numbered Apollo 6, on April 4, 1968,
was less successful. For a time it raised fears that the Moon-landing schedule had
suffered another major setback. Three serious flaws turned up. Two minutes and five
seconds after launch the 363-foot Saturn V underwent a lengthwise oscillation, like the
motion of a pogo stick. Pogo oscillation subjects the entire space-vehicle stack to
stresses and strains that, under certain circumstances, can grow to a magnitude sufficient 
to damage or even destroy the vehicle. This motion, caused by a synchronization
of engine thrust pulsations with natural vibration frequencies of the vehicle structure,
tends to be self-amplifying as the structural oscillations disturb the flow of propellants
and thus magnify the thrust pulsations.
<br><br>
The second anomaly, loss of structural panels from the lunar module adapter
(the structural section that would house the lunar module), was originally thought to
have been caused by the pogo oscillations. Engineers at Houston were able to establish,
however, that a faulty manufacturing process was to blame. This was quickly corrected.
<br><br>

A fiery exhaust plume trails Apollo 6 during the first stage 
of launch. Second-stage
burn was marred by premature shutdown
of three of the five J-2 engines, causing the
craft to enter an elliptical rather than a
circular orbit. Many months of technical
detective work identified the bellows in one
liquid hydrogen fuel line (bottom) as
the culprit. In flight the bellows had flexed
excessively, cracked, and leaked fuel. A
redesigned fuel line substituted specially
placed bends for the bellows.

<br>
<table border=0><tr><td>
<img src="i9-2b.jpg" ALT="A picture of the new and old fuel line">

</center>
<br>

The third problem encountered on this flight was more serious. After the first
stage had finished its work, the second stage was to take over and put Apollo 6 into
orbit; then the third stage, the S-IVB, would take the CSM up to 13,800 miles, from
where reentry from the Moon would be simulated, retesting the command module heat
shield at the 25,000 mph that Apollo 4 had achieved five months earlier.
<br><br>
The second stage's five J-2 engines ignited as scheduled. About two-thirds of the
way through their scheduled burn, no. 2 engine lost thrust and a detection system shut
it down. No. 3 engine followed suit. With two-fifths of the second stage's million-pound 
thrust gone, Apollo 6, with the help of the single J-2 engine of the third stage,
still achieved orbit, though in an egg-shaped path. But when the attempt was made
to fire the third stage's engine a second time - as would be necessary to send astronauts 
into translunar trajectory - the single J-2 failed to ignite. The mission was
saved when the service module's propulsion-system engine - 20,000 pounds of thrust
as against the third stage's 225,000 - took over and sent the CSM up to the desired
13,800-mile altitude from which it reentered the atmosphere and landed in the Pacific.

<h3>DETECTIVE WORK ON THE TELEMETRY</h3>

What had happened? Ferreting out clues from mission records and the reams of
data recorded from telemetry was a fascinating story of technical detective work. More
than a thousand engineers and technicians at NASA Centers, contractor plants, and
several universities were involved in establishing causes and designing and testing fixes.
<br><br>
The solution for pogo was to modify the pre-valves of the second-stage engines so
that they could be charged with helium gas. This provided shock-absorbing accumulators 
that damped out the thrust oscillations.
<br><br>
Finding the culprit that cut off the J-2 engines involved long theorizing and
hundreds of tests that finally pinpointed a 
six-foot tube, half an inch in diameter, carrying 
liquid hydrogen to the starter cup of the engine. This line had been fitted with two
small bellows for absorbing vibration. It worked fine on ground tests because ice forming 
on the bellows provided a damping effect. But in the dryness of space - eventually
simulated in a vacuum chamber - no ice formed because there was no air from which
to draw moisture, and there the lines vibrated, cracked, and broke. The fix: replace the
bellows with bends in the tubes to take up the motion.
<br><br>
With careful engineering analysis and extensive testing we satisfied ourselves that
we understood the problems that plagued Apollo 6 and that the resulting changes were
more than adequate to commit the third Saturn V to manned flight.
<br><br>
At this point we planned that the next Saturn V would be the D mission, launching
Apollo 8 in December with Astronauts McDivitt, Scott, and Schweickart. Their main
objective would be to test the spider-like lunar module then abuilding at the Grumman
plant on Long Island. Early in 1968 we had set the objective of flying the D mission
before the year was out. It was a reasonable target at the time, considering progress
across the program, and would put us in an excellent position to complete the preparatory 
missions and have more than one shot at the landing in 1969.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the command and service modules, after almost two years of reworking 
at the North American Aviation plant in Downey, Calif., would have their crucial
flight test on Apollo 7, the C mission, after launch in October 1968 by the smaller
Saturn IB. On board this first manned Apollo mission would be Astronauts Schirra,
Eisele, and Cunningham.

By midsummer it was apparent that Apollo 7 would fly in October, but that the
lunar module for the D mission would not be ready for a December flight. Electromagnetic 
interference problems were plaguing checkout tests, and it was obvious that
engineering changes and further time-consuming tests were needed. After a comprehensive 
review in early August, my unhappy estimate was that the D mission would
not be ready until March 1969.

 <h3>CHAPTER 9.3</h3>

<h3>AN EARLY TRIP AROUND THE MOON</h3>

George Low, the spacecraft program manager, then put forward a daring idea:
fly the CSM on the Saturn V in December, with a dummy instead of the real LM, all
the way to the Moon. We would then make maximum progress for the program, while
we took the time necessary to work out rigorously the LM problems. Low had discussed
the feasibility of such a mission with Gilruth, Kraft, and Slayton 
at the Manned Spacecraft 
Center; I was at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida when he called to voice his
idea. The upshot was a meeting that afternoon of the Apollo management team. The
Marshall Space Flight Center at Huntsville, Ala., was a central point, considering
where we all were at the moment. George Hage, my deputy, and I joined with Debus
and Petrone of KSC for the flight to Huntsville. Von Braun, Rees, James, and Richard
of MSFC were there. Gilruth, Low, Kraft, and Slayton flew from Houston.

<br>

We discussed designing a flexible mission so that, depending on many factors,
including results of the Apollo 7 flight, we could commit Apollo 8 to an Earth-orbit
flight, or a flight to a few hundred or several thousand miles away from Earth, or to a
lunar flyby, or to spending several hours in lunar orbit. The three-hour conference
didn't turn up any "show-stoppers". Quite the opposite; while there were many details
to be reexamined, it indeed looked as if we could do it. The gloom that had permeated
our previous program review was replaced by excitement. We agreed to meet in Washington 
five days later. If more complete investigation uncovered no massive roadblocks, 
I would fly to Vienna for an exegesis to my boss, Dr. George E. Mueller,
Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, and to the NASA Administrator,
James Webb, who were attending a United Nations meeting on the Peaceful Uses of
Outer Space. (Going to Vienna was at 
first considered necessary, lest other communications 
tip off the Russians, believed to be planning a Moon spectacular of their own.
Eventually it was decided that my appearance in Vienna would trip more alarms than
overseas telephone conversations.)

<br><br>
Many problems remained. The high-gain antenna was an uncertain quantity;
but Kraft agreed that the mission could be flown safely with the omniantennas, even
though television might be lost. What should we carry in lieu of the LM? The answer
was the LM test article that had been through the dynamics program at Marshall.
Deke Slayton wanted to leave McDivitt and his crew assigned to the first LM mission;
so the next crew, Borman, Lovell, and Anders, scheduled for the E mission, were
brought forward for the newly defined Apollo 8 mission. McDivitt's mission retained
its D designation, and Borman's was labeled "C-Prime".
<br><br>
Upon returning to Washington, I presented the plan to Thomas O. Paine, Acting
Administrator in Webb's absence. Paine reminded me that the program had fallen
behind, pogo had occurred on the last flight, three engines had failed, and we had not
yet flown a manned Apollo mission; yet "now you want to up the ante. Do you really
want to do this, Sam?" My answer was, "Yes, sir, as a flexible mission, provided our
detailed examination in days to come doesn't turn up any show-stoppers." Said Paine,
"We'll have a hell of a time selling it to Mueller and Webb."
<br><br>
He was right. A telephone conversation with Mueller in Vienna found him
skeptical and cool. Mr. Webb was clearly shaken by the abrupt proposal and by the
consequences of possible failure.

Lifting off for the first time with men aboard, 
the Saturn IB and its hydrogen-fueled upper stage
carry the Apollo 7 command and service module 
toward Earth orbit. This was the first trial of the
intensively reengineered CSM, and to the relief of 
NASA it performed beautifully, staying in
orbit for 10.8 days, longer than a Moon landing 
mission would require.
</table>
</center>

<br><br>
On August 15 Paine and I sent Webb and Mueller a seven-page cable with suggested 
wording of a press release saying lunar orbit was being retained as an option in
the December flight, the decision to depend on the success of Apollo 7 in October.
Webb replied from Vienna via State Department code, accepting the crew switches
and schedule changes. But he proposed saying only that "studies will be carried out
and plans prepared so as to provide reasonable flexibility in establishing final mission
objectives" after Apollo 7.
<br><br>
Paine interpreted Webb's instructions "liberally", and authorized me to say in an
August 19 press conference, upon announcing the McDivitt-Borman switch, that a
circumlunar flight or lunar orbit were possible options. I am told that I diminished the
possibility so thoroughly, by saying repeatedly "the basic mission is Earth orbit", that
the press at first mostly missed the point.

October 11 at Cape Kennedy was hot but the heat was tempered by a pleasant
breeze when Apollo 7 lifted off in a two-tongued blaze of orange-colored flame at
11:02:45. The Saturn IB, in its first trial with men aboard, provided a perfect launch
and its first stage dropped off 2 minutes 25 seconds later. The S-IVB second stage
took over, giving astronauts their first ride atop a load of liquid hydrogen, and at
5 minutes 54 seconds into the mission, Walter Schirra, the commander, reported, "She
is riding like a dream". About five minutes later an elliptical orbit had been achieved,
140 by 183 miles above the Earth. The S-IVB stayed with the CSM for about one and
one-half orbits, then separaten. Schirra fired the CSM's small rockets to pull 50 feet
ahead of the S-IVB, then turned the spacecraft around to simulate docking, as would
be necessary to extract an LM for a Moon landing. Next day, when the CSM and the
S-IVB were about 80 miles apart, Schirra and his mates sought out the lifeless,
tumbling 59-foot craft in a rendezvous simulation and approached within 70 feet.

<b>Graduated missions led confidently to a landing on the Moon</b>
<br><br>
We designed seven types of missions to
test the suitability and safety of all equipment 
in all mission phases. These were
designated by letters A through G:
<br><br>
<ol type=A>
<li>Unmanned flights of launch vehicles and
the CSM, to demonstrate the adequacy of
their design and to certify safety for men.
Five of these flights were flown between
February 1966 and April 1968; Apollo 6
was the last.
<br><br>
<li>Unmanned flight of the LM, to demonstrate 
the adequacy of its design and to
certify its safety for men. The flight of
Apollo 5 in January 1968 accomplished this.
<br><br>
<li>Manned flight to demonstrate performance 
and operability of the CSM. Apollo 7,
which flew an eleven-day mission in low
Earth orbit in October 1968, was a C
mission. Apollo 8, which flew the CSM into
lunar orbit in December 1968 was also a C
mission, but designated as C-Prime, 
to distinguish it from the prior flight.
<br><br>
<li>Manned flight of the complete lunar
landing mission vehicle in low Earth orbit
to demonstrate operability of all the equipment 
and (insofar as could be done in
Earth orbit) to perform the maneuvers involved 
in the ultimate mission. Apollo 9,
which flew in March 1969, satisfied this
requirement.
<br><br>
<li>Manned flight of the complete lunar-landing 
mission vehicle in Earth orbit to
great distances from Earth. When the time
came to commit this mission to flight, we
decided that we had already accomplished
its objectives and that it was not required.
But because this mission was in the program,
we had made detailed plans for it, and in
fact pulled much of the planning, preparation, 
and training forward to use in the
Apollo 8 lunar-orbit mission.
<br><br>
<li>This was a complete mission except for
the final descent to and landing an the
lunar surface. Apollo 10, flown by Stafford,
in May 1969, was an F mission. The need
for this mission was hotly debated. Here we
would be, 50,000 feet above the Moon,
having accepted much of the risk inherent
in landing. The temptation to go the rest of
the way was great; but this mission demonstrated 
the soundness of the strategy of
"biting off chunks". The training and 
confidence of readiness that the Apollo 10 mission 
gave the entire organization was of inestimable 
value.
<br><br>
<li>The initial lunar-landing mission. This, of
course, was accomplished by Armstrong,
Aldrin, and Collins in July 1969.

<h3>A SUPERB SPACECRAFT</h3>

During the 163 orbits of Apollo 7 the ghost of Apollo 204 was effectively exorcised 
as the new Block II spacecraft and its millions of parts performed superbly. Durability 
was shown for 10.8 days - longer than a journey to the Moon and back. A
momentary shudder went through Mission Control when both AC buses dropped out
of the spacecraft's electrical system, coincident with automatic cycles of the cryogenic
oxygen tank fans and heaters; but manual resetting of the AC bus breakers restored
normal service. Three of the five spacecraft windows fogged because of improperly
cured sealant compound (a condition that could not be fixed until Apollo 9). Chargers
for the batteries needed for reentry (after fuel cells departed with the SM) returned
50 to 75 percent less energy than expected. Most serious was the overheating of fuel
cells, which might have failed when the spacecraft was too far from Earth to return on
batteries, even if fully charged. But each of these anomalies was satisfactorily checked
out before Apollo 8 flew.

The CSM's service propulsion system, which had to fire the CSM into and out of
Moon orbit, worked perfectly during eight burns lasting from half a second to 67.6
seconds. Apollo's flotation bags had their first try-out when the spacecraft, a "lousy
boat", splashed down south of Bermuda and turned upside down; when inflated, the
brightly colored bags flipped it aright.
<br><br>
In retrospect it seems inconceivable, but serious debate ensued in NASA councils 
on whether television should be broadcast from Apollo missions, and the decision
to carry the little 4 1/2-pound camera was not made until just before this October flight.
Although these early pictures were crude, I think it was informative for the public to
see astronauts floating weightlessly in their roomy spacecraft, snatching floating objects,
and eating the first hot food consumed in space. Like the television pictures, the food
improved in later missions.

"Stable two", an engineering euphemism for 
upside-down, was one of the ways that the command 
module could float and this was the way that 
Apollo 7 splashed down. The astronauts
hung from their restraining belts for a few 
minutes until three righting bags were inflated to
flip the spacecraft. The photo sequence above

Apollo 7's achievement led to a rapid review of Apollo 8's options. The Apollo 7
astronauts went through six days of debriefing for the benefit of Apollo 8, and on
October 28 the Manned Space Flight Management Council chaired by Mueller met at
MSC, investigating every phase of the forthcoming mission. Next day came a lengthy
systems review of Apollo 8's Spacecraft 103. Paine made the go/no-go review of lunar
orbit on November 11 at NASA Headquarters in Washington. By this time nearly
all the skeptics bad become converts.
<br><br>
At the end of this climactic meeting Mueller put a recommendation for lunar
orbit into writing, and Paine approved it. He telephoned the decision to the White
House, and the message was laid on President Johnson's desk while he was conferring
with Richard M. Nixon, elected his successor six days earlier.

<h3>LIFTING FROM A SEA OF FLAME</h3>

In the pink dawn of December 21 a quarter million persons lined the approaches
to Cape Kennedy, many of them having camped overnight. At 7:51, amid a noise
that sounded from three miles away like a million-ton truck rumbling over a corrugated
road, the first manned Saturn V, an alabaster column as big as a naval destroyer,
lifted slowly, ever so slowly, from the sea of flame that engulfed Pad 39-A. The
upward pace quickened as the first stage's 531,000 gallons of kerosene and liquid
oxygen were thirstily consumed, and in 2 minutes 34 seconds the big drink was
finished, whereupon the second stage's five J-2 engines lit up. S-II's 359,000 gallons
of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen boosted the S-IVB and CSM for 6 minutes
10 seconds to an altitude of 108 miles. After the depleted S-II fell away, the S-IVB,
this time the third stage, fired for 2 minutes 40 seconds to achieve Earth orbit. Except
for slight pogo during the second-stage burn, Commander Borman reported all was
smoothness.

Like a whirling dervish, the path of Apollo 8
about the Earth and Moon spanned seven days
and well over half a million miles. Ten lunar
revolutions, at distances as close as 60 miles, were
made. Translunar trip takes about 20 percent
longer than the return trip because going out one
has to overcome the stronger gravity of the Earth
but can capitalize on it coming back. Not shown

S-IVB stage.

During the second orbit, at 2 hours 27 minutes, CapCom Mike Collins sang out
"You are go for TLI" (translunar injection), and 23 minutes after that Lovell calmly
said, "Ignition". The S-IVB had restarted with a long burn over Hawaii that lasted
5 minutes 19 seconds and boosted speed to the 24,200 mph necessary to escape the
bonds of Earth. "You are on your way", said Chris Kraft, from the last row of consoles
in Mission Control, "you are really on your way". The anticlimactic observation of the
day came when Lovell said, "Tell Conrad he lost his record". (During Gemini 11 Pete
Conrad and Dick Gordon had set an altitude record of 850 miles.) After the burn the
S-IVB separated and was sent on its way to orbit the Sun.

In Mission Control early in the morning of December 24 the big center screen,
which had carried an illuminated Mercator projection of the Earth for the past three

a dramatic change. The Earth disappeared, and upon the screen was flashed a
scarred and pockmarked map with such labels as Mare Tranquillitatis, Mare Crisium,
and many craters with such names as Tsiolkovsky, Grimaldi, and Gilbert. The effect
was electrifying, symbolic evidence that man had reached the vicinity of the Moon.

CapCom Gerry Carr spoke to the three astronauts more than 200,000 miles away,
"Ten seconds to go. You are GO all the way." Lovell replied, "We'll see you on the
other side", and Apollo 8 disappeared behind the Moon, the first time in history men
had been occulted. For 34 minutes there would be no way of knowing what happened.
During that time the 247-second LOI (lunar orbit insertion) burn would take place
that would slow down the spacecraft from 5758 to 3643 mph to enable it to latch on
to the Moon's field of gravity and go into orbit. If the SPS engine failed, Apollo 8 would
whip around the Moon and head back for Earth on a free-return trajectory ( la Apollo
13); during one critical half minute if the engine conked out the spacecraft would be
sent crashing into the Moon.

<h3>ORBITING THE MOON CHRISTMAS EVE</h3>

"Longest four minutes I ever spent", said Lovell during the burn, in a comment
recorded but not broadcast in real time. At 69 hours 15 minutes Apollo 8 went into
lunar orbit, whereupon Anders said, "Congratulations, gentlemen, you are at zero-zero". 
Said Borman, "It's not time for congratulations yet. Dig out the flight plan."
<br><br>
Unaware of this conversation, Mission Control buzzed with nervous chatter. Carr
began seeking a signal to indicate that the astronauts were indeed in orbit: "Apollo 8,
Apollo 8, Apollo 8." Then the voice of Jim Lovell came through calmly, "Go ahead,
Houston."

Mission Control's viewing-room spectators broke into cheers and loud applause.
Apollo 8 was in a 168.5 by 60 mile orbit on this day before Christmas.
"What does the old Moon look like from 60 miles?" asked CapCom.
"Essentially gray; no color," said Lovell, "like plaster of paris or a sort of grayish
beach sand." The craters all seemed to be rounded off; some of them had cones within
them; others had rays. Anders added: "We are coming up on the craters Colombo
and Gutenberg. Very good detail visible. We can see the long, parallel faults of
Goclenius and they run through the mare material right into the highland Material."
<br><br>
During the second egg-shaped orbit the astronauts produced the Moon on black-and-white 
television (color would not come until Apollo 10). It proved to be a
desolate place indeed, a plate of gray steel spattered by a million bullets. "It certainly
would not appear to be an inviting place to live or work", Borman said later.

On the third revolution the SPS engine fired nine seconds to put the spacecraft
into a circular orbit, 60.7 by 59.7 miles, where it would stay for sixteen hours longer
(each orbit lasted two hours, as against one and one-half hours for Earth).
<br><br>
At 8:40 p.m. the astronauts were on television again. First, they showed the half
Earth across a stark lunar landscape. Then, from the other unfogged window, they
tracked the bleak surface of the Moon. "The vast loneliness is awe-inspiring and it
makes you realize just what you have back there on Earth", said Lovell. The pictures
aroused great wonder with an estimated half billion people vicariously exploring what
no man had ever seen before.
<br><br>
"For all the people on Earth," said Anders, "the crew of Apollo 8 has a
message we would like to send you." He paused a moment and then began reading:
<br><br>
<i>In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth.</i>
After four verses of Genesis, Lovell took up the reading:
<i>And God called the light Day and the darkness he called Night.</i>
At the end of the eighth verse Borman picked up the familiar words:
<i>And God said, Let the waters under the Heavens be gathered
together unto one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of
the waters He called seas; and God saw that it was good.</i>
<br><br>
The commander added: "And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good
night, good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you-all of you on the
good Earth." It was a time of rare emotion. The mixture of the season, the immortal
words, the ancient Moon, and the new technolgy made for an extraordinarily
effective setting.

<h3>A LUNAR CHRISTMAS</h3>

"At some point in the history of the world", editorialized The Washington Post,
"someone may have read the first ten verses of the Book of Genesis under conditions
that gave them greater meaning than they had on Christmas Eve. But it seems
unlikely ... This Christmas will always be remembered as the lunar one."
<br><br>
The New York Times, which called Apollo 8 "the most fantastic voyage of all
times", said on December 26: "There was more than narrow religious significance in
the emotional high point of their fantastic odyssey."
<br><br>
As Apollo 8 began its tenth and last orbit, CapCom Ken Mattingly told the
astronauts: "We have reviewed all your systems. You have a GO to TEI" (trans-earth 
injection). This time the crew really was in thrall to the SPS engine.
It had to ignite in this most apprehensive moment of the mission, else Apollo 8
would be left in lunar orbit, its passengers' lives measured by the length of their oxygen
supply. Ignite it did, in a 303-second burn that would effect touchdown in just under
58 hours. Apollo 8 reentered at 25,000 mph and splashed down south of Hawaii
two days after Christmas.
<br><br>
The stupendous effect of Apollo 8 was strengthened by color photographs published 
after the return. Not only was the technology of going to the Moon brilliantly
proven; men began to view the Earth as "small and blue and beautiful in that
eternal silence", as Archibald MacLeish put it, and to realize as never before that
their planet was worth working to save. The concept that Earth was itself a kind
of spacecraft needing attention to its habitability spread more widely than ever.
<br><br>
During the last week of 1968 the Associated Press repolled its 1278 newspaper
editors, who overwhelmingly voted Apollo 8 the story of the year. Time discarded
"The Dissenter" in favor of Borman, Lovell, and Anders; and a friend telegraphed
Frank Borman, "You have bailed out 1968."

<br><br>
The Apollo 9 and 10 missions were the learning phase of the
program, coming as they did between the first tests of the
command module in deep space on Apollo 8 and the lunar landing of
Apollo 11.
<br><br>
Apollo 9 and 10 were missions designed to rehearse all the
steps and reproduce all the events of the Apollo 11 mission with
the single exception of the lunar touchdown, stay, and liftoff.
The command and service modules and the lunar module were used in
flight procedures identical to those that would later take
similar vehicles to the Moon and a landing. The flight mechanics,
the mission support systems, the communications, the recording of
data - all these techniques and components were tested in a final
round of verification.
<br><br>
We learned from those two missions how to develop our flight
procedures. They are complex, at best, and for future missions we
wanted to know exactly what alternatives we would have under a
wide variety of circumstances to assure the safety of the
astronauts and the success of the missions, in that order.
Fortunately we had very few problems on both missions. Three
reasons for that good fortune were the extensive ground tests,
the simulation exercises which provided the crews with high-fidelity 
training for every phase of the flight, and the critical
design review procedures.
<br><br>
The crews rehearsed and re-rehearsed their movements in
ground simulators and in conditions of inflight weightlessness
produced by parabolic flights in a converted Air Force KC-135
tanker and by neutral buoyancy simulations. They had started this
kind of training as a crew months before the flight, gradually
working toward proficiency and a degree of automatic response to
the checklists, the pilots' shorthand notes that were developed
simultaneously. By the time they were ready for their actual
missions, they had run through all the normal routines many
times, and had thoroughly rehearsed emergency procedures for
every imaginable trouble or failure.
<br><br>
The critical design reviews were fundamental to the testing
and simulation programs. What we actually did was to go over
every single part of the spacecraft to make sure that we
understood how it worked, how it might go wrong, and what
alternative procedure or backup system we had in case it did go
wrong. The overriding consideration was, of course, crew safety;
there always had to be at least one way back from orbit or from
the Moon if something went wrong. These design reviews were done
by a number of task groups, because there were too many
spacecraft systems for any single group to consider, let alone
understand to the required degree.
<br><br>
One of my areas of special interest lay in what we called
software - the computer programs that provided the intelligence
and control functions onboard the spacecraft and at the ground
stations. General Phillips asked me to form a special software
review group that met for several months and initiated some
disciplines which, I believe, finally made it possible for the
Apollo 11 lunar landing to take place when it did.
<br><br>
An interesting point about the Apollo 10 flight is that it
did fail to do one of the steps that was later done on the Apollo
11 and which caused some brief moments of tension just before the
lunar landing. On Apollo 10, the landing radar and the rendezvous
radar never were operated at the same time. They are used for two
different procedures, and at two different altitudes, so that
there didn't seem to be any need for simultaneous operation of
the pair. But on Apollo 11, they wanted to check the operation of
the high-altitude gate radar as they approached the surface of
the Moon, and so it was left on. That radar and the landing radar
were feeding information directly into the onboard computer in
the Apollo 11 lunar module. Although the data from the altitude
radar was not being used, it nevertheless was driving the input
registers of the computer and thus forcing the central processor
to decide at each cycle that the radar data were not germane.

</center>

<h3>THOSE COMPUTER ALARMS</h3>

Fortunately, in our software review we had insisted on one
point: We had to have at least a 10-percent spare capacity in the
memory of the onboard computer. We did that to provide for
unforeseen contingencies, and that contingency occurred on the
Apollo 11 lunar landing. On that mission we used up the 10
percent with those extraneous messages from the high-altitude
radar, and in spite of the spare capacity, we nearly overloaded
the landing computer. It set off alarms that caused a few seconds
of fast thinking, but it was quickly put right and the landing
went on to a safe touchdown.
<br><br>
All this critical design review was then followed by a
review of all the things that happened during the dry runs before
the final countdown, checking to make sure that there were no
anomalies that hadn't been identified and traced back to their
origins. That was done in the last couple of days before the
flight. What we were basically doing was making sure that
everybody had done everything that could be done to assure the
safety of the mission.
<br><br>
But you can only do so much in ground simulation and
analysis, and then you've got to test the articles in actual
flight. One example of this was with the docking mechanism, which
presented no particular problems in ground tests and in
simulation. But the first time it was tried in space, they had
considerable difficulty getting the mechanism into place. That
led to a very rapid redesign of the mechanism between flights,
which was just one of the things accomplished in the very short
time between flights. Looking back on it, it seems amazing that
we were able to do a number of things on those two-month centers
that would have been considered flatly impossible only a few
months earlier. The key to that ability, though, was getting
ourselves organized and then finding the will to do things. That
made all the difference in the world on the Apollo program; there
was the highest motivation, and it produced results, time and
time again.
<br><br>
Of course, after the flights we had a thorough debriefing
and evaluation of the mission, and of the behavior of the
spacecraft and other systems, checking the actual results against
our predicted performance, analyzing actual anomalies against
ones that we had expected and planned for. The rigid discipline
of postflight analysis and the preflight reviews were among the
most important inputs of Apollo management to the success of the
program.

 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
 <h3>CHAPTER 10.3</h3>
 <hr><br>
</center>

<h3>FIRST MANNED FLIGHT OF THE LM</h3>

The Apollo 9 mission was to be the first manned flight in
the lunar module, and the whole purpose of the mission was to
qualify, in flight, that portion of the overall spacecraft
system. Further, we wanted to show that the lunar module, in
combination with the command and service modules, could perform
its assigned tasks in weightless flight. It wasn't necessary to
go to the Moon for this work, so the Apollo 9 mission took place
in Earth orbit. The conditions were the same, insofar as those
qualifying tests were concerned, and we had the further advantage
of a more comfortable situation in case any problems developed.
<br><br>
It was planned to fly a ten-day mission, approximating in
time a complete trip to the Moon, a lunar landing, stay and
ascent, and then return to the Earth. We had developed a mission
profile that would put astronauts into the lunar module on three
separate occasions during the flight, first of all to check a lot
of procedures and other items, and second to do multiple
activations and deactivations of the lunar module. This mission
was the only one in which the LM was powered up and down more
than once; it was done here with the intent of discovering
anything that might go wrong, and to refine the procedures worked
out in simulations.
<br><br>
The lunar module might well be called the first true
spacecraft, since it was designed for flight only in the
environment of space. Folded and stowed as it was in the nose of
the Saturn V, its frail body caused some concern about its
ability to stand up to the stress of a Saturn launch. Some of the
earlier Saturn launches had shown what was called a pogo
oscillation, named after the pogo-stick phenomenon. We wanted to
make certain that the LM would be able to take that longitudinal
acceleration and shock. We also wanted to make sure the
mechanisms for extending its landing legs and pads would not be
jammed by unusual loads in flight, and that the adapter between
the LM and the rest of the spacecraft could take those loads.
<br><br>
Other objectives of the mission included checking propulsion
system operation in both the docked and undocked conditions, to
complete a rendezvous between the LM and the command module, with
the LM being the active partner during the maneuver, and to
demonstrate extravehicular activity from both spacecraft in order
to evaluate the case or difficulty of that kind of task, and to
check out the handholds, handrails, and localized illumination
that had been developed for EVA.
<br><br>
The crew for Apollo 9 was commanded by James A. McDivitt.
David R. Scott was the command pilot and Russell L. Schweickart
was lunar module pilot. There was an initial three-day delay, not
because of any equipment failure but because one of the crew had
a cold. Liftoff occurred on March 3, 1969, at 11 AM The normal
launch phase followed, and then the S-IVB stage was ignited to
place the spacecraft in a nearly circular Earth orbit of about
102 by 104 nautical miles. That orbit was the arena for what was
to follow. In a routine manner, the combined command and service
modules were separated from the rest of the spacecraft, turned in
space, and docked with the lunar module. About one hour later,
the docked spacecraft were ejected from the S-IVB, using the
ejection mechanism for the first time. From this point on, many
of the events were done for the first time.
<br><br>
About two hours after the ejection, the crew fired the
service propulsion system for the first time on that mission, in
a burst that lasted five seconds. It was the first of several
such firings planned to check the service module propulsion
system and the resulting maneuvering capability of the docked and
undocked spacecraft. That task also completed the list of work
for the first day in orbit. It may seem as if there was very
little for the astronauts to do on that first day, but it must be
realized that much time is spent checking and rechecking onboard
systems, the communications and telemetering links to the ground
stations, the receipt of data, and all the myriad tasks that
confront astronauts in space.
<br><br>
On the second day in Earth orbit, the crew of Apollo 9 also
spent much time in systems checks. They fired the service
propulsion system three times, each time with about a two-hour
interval between firings. Two of the firings were long, lasting
almost two and almost five minutes; the third was a shorter burst
of less than a half-minute.

<h3>DESCENT ENGINE FIRED</h3>

McDivitt and Schweickart entered the lunar module on the
third day in orbit and powered it up to check out its systems and
to fire the descent engine while in the docked condition. The
engine burn lasted more than six minutes, during which time the
crew controlled the engine manually, and also demonstrated
digital-autopilot attitude control. After returning to the
command module, the full crew made the fifth of the docked
maneuvers, using the service propulsion system.

Early on the fourth day, Schweickart and Scott began their
extravehicular activity, that spectacular and exhilarating solo
performance outside the spacecraft. Unfortunately, Schweickart
had been affected by a form of motion sickness during the
previous days, a difficulty that later led to a regime of zero-G
flights for all crews during the last days before launch. But
this time it affected the planned time line for the EVA, and it
was decided to reduce the activities outside the spacecraft.

Schweickart went into the lunar module, which was
depressurized, and left it by way of the exit hatch that would
later be used by the astronauts who landed on the Moon. He stayed
around the platform - the "front porch" as the astronauts called
it - by that hatch for about three-quarters of an hour, checking
the handholds and the lights that had been trained on specific
portions of the spacecraft. Scott, meantime, had opened the
command module hatch and clambered partially outside, still
hooked to the spacecraft through a life-support umbilical system.
<br><br>
Schweickart was using a portable life-support system in his
EVA, checking it for the first time outside. Both men detailed
their experiences, took some photographs, and retrieved some
thermal samples, testing the maneuverability of the space suits
and the accessibility of the sample locations on the spacecraft.
We had planned to have Schweickart move externally from the LM to
the command module, to verify a way of getting from one
spacecraft to the other if the tunnel were not available. This
step was not completed beyond evaluating the specific handholds
that would have been necessary to such a transfer.

 <h3>CHAPTER 10.5</h3>

<h3>THE LM ON ITS OWN</h3>

The fifth day of the Apollo 9 mission was the crucial test
for the LM. Schweickart and McDivitt entered the LM, powered it
up, and prepared to separate from the command module. They
released the craft, and the astronauts were flying free in the
LM. They backed away and rotated the module so that Scott, in the
command module, could see that all the legs were down and
extended, and that there were no physical failures in the craft
itself. Then they fired the descent engine just enough to move
the LM into a parallel orbit about three miles away from the
command module. The mechanics of the orbit were such that the LM
was on its own, but twice during each swing around the Earth? the
two spacecraft were close enough so that Scott could initiate
rescue operations should anything have happened to the EM.
<br><br>
For nearly six hours the two astronauts in the LM rehearsed
the possible phases of the lunar approach and departure. They
exercised the reaction control systems, fired the descent engine
again, then jettisoned the descent stage, and then fired the
ascent engine for the first time in space. From their adjusted
position about 10 miles below and 80 miles behind the command
module, they began their approach to a rendezvous and docking,
much the same as the actual event to take place later on Apollo
11. The first phase of their rendezvous terminated temporarily
with about a 100 foot separation, so that both spacecraft could be
photographed. Then they docked, a solid and clean joining that
verified the crews' training and the performance of the docking
and locking mechanisms. They jettisoned the ascent stage, and
remotely fired its engine to insert it into a highly elliptical
orbit around the Earth.

</table>
</center>
<br>

From here on, the rest of the mission was almost an
anticlimax, because the performance of the spacecraft left no
doubt as to its ability to make the lunar trip, complete with
landing and departure. But there was still work to be done, and
so for the remaining five days in orbit, the crew again and again
exercised the service propulsion system, once to lower the
perigee of their Earth orbit, once to test the propellant staging
system, and once to head home to Earth. On the last four days,
they also did a series of landmark tracking experiments, using
visual sightings of Earth features which were observed and
photographed. They also made a number of photographs with a
multiple-camera assembly using different film emulsions to obtain
pictures in different portions of the photographic spectrum.
These were further augmented by pictures taken almost
simultaneously with hand-held cameras, using conventional films.
<br><br>
Once out of orbit, following the eighth successive firing of
the service propulsion system, the reentry was normal. They
landed right on their target in the Atlantic, 241 hours after
takeoff, and were recovered quickly by Navy helicopters.
<br><br>
Apollo 10 was different, because it did go to the Moon- or
at least within 47,000 feet of it- in its rehearsal of the Apollo
11 mission. There had been some speculation about whether or not
the crew might have landed, having gotten so close. They might
have wanted to, but it was impossible for that lunar module to
land. It was an early design that was too heavy for a lunar
landing, or, to be more precise, too heavy to be able to complete
the ascent back to the command module. It was a test module, for
the dress rehearsal only, and that was the way it was used.
Besides, the discipline on the Apollo program was such that no
crew would have made such a decision on its own in any event.

Thomas P. Stafford was the Apollo 10 mission commander, with
command module pilot John W. Young and lunar module pilot Eugene
A. Cernan. They were launched on schedule at 11:49 AM, on May
18, 1969, about two and one-half months after Apollo 9 had set
out on its successful test flight.

<h3>THE DRESS REHEARSAL</h3>

Launching was routine, as was the establishment of the Earth
parking orbit that followed. After systems checks, and approval
from Mission Control, the crew fired the S-IVB stage engine to
leave the parking orbit and enter the translunar trajectory. Then
they separated the command and service modules from the S-IVB,
and turned to dock with the lunar module. Ejection of the docked
spacecraft followed, as the crew performed a separation maneuver
to increase the distance between the docked spacecraft and the
S-IVB stage. Then they eased the S-IVB into a solar orbit by
propulsive venting of its excess propellants.
<br><br>
The translunar trajectory had been established so precisely
that it was not necessary to make the first midcourse correction,
generally a routine step during the early phases of the flight
toward the Moon. Finally, after a little more than a day in
flight, a single translunar midcourse correction was done to make
the flight path of Apollo 10 coincide with the trajectory planned
for the Apollo 11 mission. Three days and four hours away from
the launch pad, the crew fired the service propulsion system for
almost six minutes, inserting the spacecraft into a lunar orbit.
Apollo 10 now was orbiting the Moon in a circular flight path
about 60 miles above its surface.
<br><br>
Stafford and Cernan entered the lunar module about six hours
later to check the systems. They transferred some needed
equipment, and moved back into the command module for a normal
sleep period. They then recentered the lunar module to go through
a complete systems check to prepare for the lunar-orbit
rendezvous, the final check of the flight mechanics of the Apollo
mission.
<br><br>
Just after two hours into the fourth day, the two spacecraft
were undocked and separated. The crew performed its routine
communications and radar checks, and then Stafford and Cernan
began their descent toward the lunar surface by firing the
descent stage engine. They let down to an altitude of about eight
miles above the surface, the closest they were to go in that
mission. Over one of the selected landing sites, they checked the
landing radar, which worked successfully. After this descent,
Stafford and Cernan maneuvered the LM into an elliptical orbit.
11 by 190 miles, to establish the conditions for their rendezvous
with Young in the command module. They completed one swing around
the Moon? and then staged the lunar module, firing its ascent
engine in a simulation of a return from the lunar surface.
<br><br>
These words read rapidly, as if the performance they
describe were done swiftly. But it must be appreciated that this
rehearsal, which was planned to follow the schedule for the
Apollo 11 as closely as possible, actually took more than six and
one-half hours from the beginning of the descent toward the Moon
until both spacecraft had docked for the second time for crew
transfer back to the CSM.

<h3>FLAWLESS RENDEZVOUS</h3>

The rendezvous was flawless. It began with the usual
maneuvering by the LM, using its reaction control system. Young,
in the command module, nominally had nothing to do except to wait
passively for the docking; the lunar module was expected to be
the active seeker and mover in the rendezvous. But in fact he had
to be prepared to take over the rendezvous if anything failed on
the LM. So he checked the rendezvous every step of the way with
sextant observations and ranging with very-high-frequency radio,
working out the things he would have to do in the event of a
lunar module system failure. The terminal phase of the docking
began an hour later, and the lunar module nudged its way into the
locking mechanism of the command module. The jubilant crews met
back in the command module.

<br>

For the final day in lunar orbit, Stafford, Young, and
Cernan spent their time in a series of experiments that would add
to the general fund of Apollo knowledge. They tracked landmarks.
worked on alignment exercises for the inertial platform, and took
a series of stereo-pair and sequence photographs of the lunar
surface, singling out features that would guide future
landing-site selections. And then it was time for the return to
Earth.
<br><br>
They fired the service module engine once again to move out
of the lunar orbit and back onto a trajectory toward the Earth,
using a fast-return flight path that would bring them back again
in 54 hours. The flight path again was established with great
precision; the only midcourse correction needed was done just
about three hours before the reentry, and it changed the velocity
by slightly more than two feet per second, or about one part in
20,000.

Fifteen minutes before reentry, they separated the command
module from the service module. The command module bearing the
crew streaked through the atmosphere; the parachutes deployed and
let the spacecraft down on their target coordinates. The
astronauts always made much of the accuracy of their landings,
with a pool going to the crew landing closest to the target. (In
fact, the navigation and guidance accuracy was such that the
spacecraft computers pinpointed the target location better than
the recovery ships were able to. Later, ships used inertial
navigation that was as accurate as that in the spacecraft, but
their captains stood off by a mile or two from the landing point
to avoid any possibility of a collision.) Navy helicopters swung
over their rafts, lifted the crew and took them back to the
recovery carrier, the USS Princeton, within 39 minutes after the
craft had hit the water. About an hour later, the spacecraft
itself was hoisted. charred and dripping, onto the deck of the

These two flights had been successful; more, they had been

the pace and the direction of the program before Apollo 9 and 10.
The thoroughness of the approach, the critical design reviews,
and the extensive test and simulation work on the ground had

<b>Prelude

All was ready. Everything had been done. Projects Mercury
and Gemini. Seven years of Project Apollo. The work of more than
300,000 Americans. Six previous unmanned and manned Apollo
flights. Planning, testing, analyzing, training. The time had
come.
<br><br>
We had a great deal of confidence. We had confidence in our
hardware: the Saturn rocket, the command module, and the lunar
module. All flight segments had been flown on the earlier Apollo
fights with the exception of the descent to and the accent from
the Moon's surface and, of course, the exploration work on the
surface. These portions were far from trivial, however, and we
had concentrated our training on them. Months of simulation with
our colleagues in the Mission Control Center had convinced us
that they were ready.
<br><br>
Although confident, we were certainly not overconfident. In
research and in exploration, the unexpected is always expected.
We were not overly concerned with our safety, but we would not be
surprised if a malfunction or an unforeseen occurrence prevented
a successful lunar landing.
<br><br>
As we ascended in the elevator to the top of the Saturn on
the morning of July 16, 1969, we knew that hundreds of thousands
of Americans had given their best effort to give us this chance.
Now it was time for us to give our best.

<i>
The splashdown May 26, 1969, of Apollo 10 cleared the way
for the first formal attempt at a manned lunar landing. Six days
before, the Apollo 11 launch vehicle and spacecraft half crawled
from the VAB and trundled at 0.9 mph to Pad 39-A. A successful
countdown test ending on July 3 showed the readiness of machines,
systems, and people. The next launch window (established by
lighting conditions at the landing site on Mare Tranquillitatis)
opened at 9:32 AM EDT on July 16, 1969. The crew for Apollo 11,
all of whom had already flown in space during Gemini, had been
intensively training as a team for many months. The following
mission account makes use of crew members' own words, from books
written by two of them, supplemented by space-to-ground and
press-conference transcripts.
</i>
<br><br>
ALDRIN: At breakfast early on the morning of the launch. Dr.
Thomas Paine, the Administrator of NASA, told us that concern for
our own safety must govern all our actions, and if anything
looked wrong we were to abort the mission. He then made a most
surprising and unprecedented statement: if we were forced to
abort, we would be immediately recycled and assigned to the next
landing attempt. What he said and how he said it was very
reassuring.
<br><br>
We were up early, ate, and began to suit up - a rather
laborious and detailed procedure involving many people, which we
would repeat once again, alone, before entering the LM for our
lunar landing.
<br><br>
While Mike and Neil were going through the complicated
business of being strapped in and connected to the spacecraft's
life-support system, I waited near the elevator on the floor
below. I waited alone for fifteen minutes in a sort of serene
limbo. As far as I could see there were people and cars lining
the beaches and highways. The surf was just beginning to rise out
of an azure-blue ocean. I could see the massiveness of the Saturn
V rocket below and the magnificent precision of Apollo above. I
savored the wait and marked the minutes in my mind as something I
would always want to remember.

Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., then an Air Force colonel, was the lunar
module pilot for Apollo 11 . He had graduated third in his class
at West Point, and earned a Ph.D. in astronautics at MIT. His
prior space experience was as pilot for Gemini 12.
</table>
</center>
<br>

COLLINS: I am everlastingly thankful that I have flown
before, and that this period of waiting atop a rocket is nothing
new. I am just as tense this time, but the tenseness comes mostly
from an appreciation of the enormity of our undertaking rather
than from the unfamiliarity of the situation. I am far from
certain that we will be able to fly the mission as planned. I
think we will escape with our skins, or at least I will escape
with mine, but I wouldn't give better than even odds on a
successful landing and return. There arc just too many things
that can go wrong. Fred Haise [the backup astronaut who had
checked command-module switch positions] has run through a
checklist 417 steps long. and I have merely a half dozen minor
chores to take care of - nickel and dime stuff. In between switch
throws I have plenty of time to think, if not daydream. Here I
am, a white male, age thirty-eight, height 5 feet 11 inches,
weight 165 pounds, salary $17,000 per annum, resident of a Texas
suburb, with black spot on my roses, state of mind unsettled,
about to be shot off to the Moon. Yes, to the Moon.
<br><br>
At the moment, the most important control is over on Neil's
side, just outboard of his left knee. It is the abort handle, and
now it has power to it, so if Neil rotates it 30
counterclockwise, three solid rockets above us will fire and yank
the CM free of the service module and everything below it. It is
only to be used in extremes. A large bulky pocket has been added
to Neil's left suit leg, and it looks as though if he moves his
leg slightly, it's going to snag on the abort handle. I quickly
point this out to Neil, and he grabs the pocket and pulls it as
far over to the inside of his thigh as he can, but it still doesn't
look secure to either one of us. Jesus, I can see the headlines now:
"MOONSHOT FALLS INTO OCEAN." Mistake by crew, program officials
intimate. Last transmission from Armstrong prior to leaving the
pad reportedly was 'Oops.'"

ARMSTRONG: The flight started promptly, and I think that was
characteristic of all events of the flight. The Saturn gave us
one magnificent ride, both in Earth orbit and on a trajectory to
the Moon. Our memory of that differs little from the reports you
have heard from the previous Saturn V flights.

ALDRIN: For the thousands of people watching along the
beaches of Florida and the millions who watched on television,
our lift-off was ear shattering. For us there was a slight
increase in the amount of background noise, not at all unlike the
sort one notices taking off in a commercial airliner, and in less
than a minute we were traveling ahead of the speed of sound.

We are thrown left and right against our straps in spasmodic
little jerks. It is steering like crazy, like a nervous lady

civilian, had flown in space in Gemini 8. An
engineer and test pilot, he once flew the X-15
above 200,000 feet and at more than 4000 mph.

<br>

ALDRIN: A busy eleven minutes later we were in Earth orbit.
The Earth didn't look much different from the way it had during
my first flight, and yet I kept looking at it. From space it has
an almost benign quality. Intellectually one could realize there
were wars underway, but emotionally it was impossible to
understand such things. The thought reoccurred that wars are
generally fought for territory or are disputes over borders; from
space the arbitrary borders established on Earth cannot be seen.
After one and a half orbits a preprogrammed sequence fired the
Saturn to send us out of Earth orbit and on our way to the Moon.
<br><br>
ARMSTRONG: Hey Houston, Apollo 11. This Saturn gave us a
magnificent ride. We have no complaints with any of the three
stages on that ride. It was beautiful.
<br><br>
COLLINS: We started the burn at 100 miles altitude, and had
reached only 180 at cutoff, but we are climbing like a dingbat.
In nine hours, when we are scheduled to make our first midcourse
correction, we will be 57,000 miles out. At the instant of
shutdown, Buzz recorded our velocity as 35,579 feet per second,
more than enough to escape from the Earth's gravitational field.
As we proceed outbound, this number will get smaller and smaller
until the tug of the Moon's gravity exceeds that of the Earth's
and then we will start speeding up again. It's hard to believe
that we are on our way to the Moon, at 1200 miles altitude now,
less than three hours after liftoff, and I'll bet the launch-day
crowd down at the Cape is still bumper to bumper, straggling back
to the motels and bars.
<br><br>
ALDRIN: Mike's next major task, with Neil and me assisting,
was to separate our command module Columbia from the Saturn third
stage, turn around and connect with the lunar module Eagle, which
was stored in the third stage. Eagle, by now, was exposed; its
four enclosing panels had automatically come off and were
drifting away. This of course was a critical maneuver in the
flight plan. If the separation and docking did not work, we would
return to Earth. There was also the possibility of an in-space
collision and the subsequent decompression of our cabin, so we
were still in our spacesuits as Mike separated us from the Saturn
third stage. Critical as the maneuver is, I felt no apprehension
about it, and if there was the slightest inkling of concern it
disappeared quickly as the entire separation and docking
proceeded perfectly to completion. The nose of Columbia was now
connected to the top of the Eagle and heading for the Moon as we
watched the Saturn third stage venting, a propulsive maneuver
causing it to move slowly away from us.
<br><br>
<i>
Fourteen hours after liftoff, at 10:30 PM by Houston time,
the three astronauts fasten covers over the windows of the slowly
rotating command module and go to sleep. Days 2 and 3 are devoted
to housekeeping chores, a small midcourse velocity correction,
and TV transmissions back to Earth. In one news digest from
Houston, the astronauts are amused to hear that Pravda has
referred to Armstrong as "the czar of the ship".
</i>
<br><br>
ALDRIN: In our preliminary flight plan I wasn't scheduled to
go to the LM until the next day in lunar orbit, but I had lobbied
successfully to go earlier. My strongest argument was that I'd
have ample time to make sure that the frail LM and its equipment
had suffered no damage during the launch and long trip. By that
time neither Neil nor I had been in the LM for about two weeks.

<h3>THE MOST AWESOME SPHERE</h3>

COLLINS: Day 4 has a decidedly different feel to it. Instead
of nine hours' sleep, I get seven - and fitful ones at that.
Despite our concentrated effort to conserve our energy on the way
to the Moon, the pressure is overtaking us (or me at least), and
I feel that all of us are aware that the honeymoon is over and we
are about to lay our little pink bodies on the line. Our first
shock comes as we stop our spinning motion and swing ourselves
around so as to bring the Moon into view. We have not been able
to see the Moon for nearly a day now, and the change is
electrifying. The Moon I have known all my life, that two-dimensional 
small yellow disk in the sky, has gone away
somewhere, to be replaced by the most awesome sphere I have ever
seen. To begin with it is huge, completely filling our window.
Second, it is three-dimensional. The belly of it bulges out
toward us in such a pronounced fashion that I almost feel I can
reach out and touch it. To add to the dramatic effect, we can see
the stars again. We are in the shadow of the Moon now, and the
elusive stars have reappeared.

<br>

As we ease around on the left side of the Moon, I marvel
again at the precision of our path. We have missed hitting the
Moon by a paltry 300 nautical miles, at a distance of nearly a
quarter of a million miles from Earth, and don't forget that the
Moon is a moving target and that we are racing through the sky
just ahead of its leading edge. When we launched the other day
the Moon was nowhere near where it is now; it was some 40 degrees
of are, or nearly 200,000 miles, behind where it is now, and yet
those big computers in the basement in Houston didn't even
whimper but belched out super-accurate predictions.
<br><br>
As we pass behind the Moon, we have just over eight minutes
to go before the burn. We are super-careful now, checking and
rechecking each step several times. When the moment finally
arrives, the big engine instantly springs into action and
reassuringly plasters us back in our seats. The acceleration is
only a fraction of one G but it feels good nonetheless. For six
minutes we sit there peering intent as hawks at our instrument
panel, scanning the important dials and gauges, making sure that
the proper thing is being done to us. When the engine shuts down,
we discuss the matter with our computer and I read out the
results: "Minus one, plus one, plus one." The accuracy of the
overall system is phenomenal: out of a total of nearly three
thousand feet per second, we have velocity errors in our body
axis coordinate system of only a tenth of one foot per second in
each of the three directions. That is one accurate burn, and even
Neil acknowledges the fact.

<br>

ALDRIN: The second burn to place us in closer circular orbit
of the Moon, the orbit from which Neil and I would separate from
the Columbia and continue on to the Moon, was critically
important. It had to be made in exactly the right place and for
exactly the correct length of time. If we overburned for as
little as two seconds we'd be on an impact course for the other
side of the Moon. Through a complicated and detailed system of
checks and balances, both in Houston and in lunar orbit, plus
star checks and detailed platform alignments, two hours after our
first lunar orbit we made our second burn, in an atmosphere of
nervous and intense concentration. It, too, worked perfectly.

<h3>ASLEEP IN LUNAR ORBIT</h3>

We began preparing the LM. It was scheduled to take three
hours, but because I had already started the checkout, we were
completed a half hour ahead of schedule. Reluctantly we returned
to the Columbia as planned. Our fourth night we were to sleep in
lunar orbit. Although it was not in the flight plan, before
covering the windows and dousing the lights, Neil and I carefully
prepared all the equipment and clothing we would need in the
morning, and mentally ran through the many procedures we would
follow.
<br><br>
COLLINS: "Apollo 11, Apollo 11, good morning from the Black
Team." Could they be talking to me? It takes me twenty seconds to
fumble for the microphone button and answer groggily, I guess I
have only been asleep five hours or so; I had a tough time
getting to sleep, and now I'm having trouble waking up. Neil,
Buzz, and I all putter about fixing breakfast and getting various
items ready for transfer into the LM. [Later] I stuff Neil and
Buzz into the LM along with an armload of equipment. Now I have
to do the tunnel bit again, closing hatches, installing drogue
and probe, and disconnecting the electrical umbilical. I am on
the radio constantly now, running through an elaborate series of
joint checks with Eagle. I check progress with Buzz: "I have five
minutes and fifteen seconds since we started. Attitude is holding
very well." "Roger, Mike, just hold it a little bit longer." "No
sweat, I can hold it all day. Take your sweet time. How's the
czar over there? He's so quiet." Neil chimes in, "Just hanging
on- and punching." Punching those computer buttons, I guess he
means. "All I can say is, beware the revolution," and then,
getting no answer, I formally bid them goodbye. "You cats take it
easy on the lunar surface...." "O.K., Mike," Buzz answers
cheerily, and I throw the switch which releases them. With my
nose against the window and the movie camera churning away, I
watch them go. When they are safely clear of me, I inform Neil,
and he begins a slow pirouette in place, allowing me a look at
his outlandish machine and its four extended legs. "The Eagle has
wings'" Neil exults.
<br><br>
It doesn't look like any eagle I have ever seen. It is the
weirdest-looking contraption ever to invade the sky, floating
there with its legs awkwardly jutting out above a body which has
neither symmetry nor grace. I make sure all four landing gears
arc down and locked, report that fact, and then lie a little, "I
think you've got a fine-looking flying machine there. Eagle,
despite the fact you're upside down." "Somebody's upside down,"
Neil retorts. "O.K., Eagle. One minute . . . you guys take care."
Neil answers, "See you later." I hope so. When the one minute is
up, I fire my thrusters precisely as planned and we begin to
separate, checking distances and velocities as we go. This burn
is a very small one, just to give Eagle some breathing room. From
now on it's up to them, and they will make two separate burns in
reaching the lunar surface. The first one will serve to drop
Eagle's perilune to fifty thousand feet. Then, when they reach
this spot over the eastern edge of the Sea of Tranquility,
Eagle's descent engine will be fired up for the second and last
time, and Eagle will lazily are over into a 12-minute computer-
controlled descent to some point at which Neil will take over for
a manual landing.
<br><br>
ALDRIN: We were still 60 miles above the surface when we
began our first burn. Neil and I were harnessed into the LM in a
standing position. [Later] at precisely the right moment the
engine ignited to begin the 12-minute powered descent. Strapped
in by the system of belts and cables not unlike shock absorbers,
neither of us felt the initial motion. We looked quickly at the
computer to make sure we were actually functioning as planned.
After 26 seconds the engine went to full throttle and the motion
became noticeable. Neil watched his instruments while I looked at
our primary computer and compared it with our second computer,
which was part of our abort guidance system.
<br><br>
I then began a computer read-out sequence to Neil which was
also being transmitted to Houston. I had helped develop it. It
sounded as though I was chattering like a magpie. It also sounded
as though I was doing all the work. During training we had
discussed the possibility of making the communication only
between Neil and myself, but Mission Control liked the idea of
hearing our communications with each other. Neil had referred to
it once as "that damned open mike of yours," and I tried to make
as little an issue of it as possible.

<h3>A YELLOW CAUTION LIGHT</h3>

At six thousand feet above the lunar surface a yellow
caution light came on and we encountered one of the few
potentially serious problems in the entire flight, a problem
which might have caused us to abort, had it not been for a man on
the ground who really knew his job.
<br><br>
COLLINS: At five minutes into the burn, when I am nearly
directly overhead, Eagle voices its first concern. "Program
Alarm," barks Neil, "It's a 1202." What the hell is that? I don't
have the alarm numbers memorized for my own computer, much less
for the LM's. I jerk out my own checklist and start thumbing
through it, but before I can find 1202, Houston says, "Roger,
we're GO on that alarm." No problem, in other words. My checklist
says 1202 is an "executive overflow," meaning simply that the
computer has been called upon to do too many things at once and
is forced to postpone some of them. A little farther along, at
just three thousand feet above the surface, the computer flashes
1201, another overflow condition, and again the ground is
superquick to respond with reassurances.

<br>

ALDRIN: Back in Houston, not to mention on board the Eagle,
hearts shot up into throats while we waited to learn what would
happen. We had received two of the caution lights when Steve
Bales the flight controller responsible for LM computer activity,
told us to proceed, through Charlie Duke, the capsule
communicator. We received three or four more warnings but kept on
going. When Mike, Neil, and I were presented with Medals of
Freedom by President Nixon, Steve also received one. He certainly
deserved it, because without him we might not have landed.
<br><br>
ARMSTRONG: In the final phases of the descent after a number
of program alarms, we looked at the landing area and found a very
large crater. This is the area we decided we would not go into;
we extended the range downrange. The exhaust dust was kicked up
by the engine and this caused some concern in that it degraded
our ability to determine not only our altitude in the final
phases but also our translational velocities over the ground.
It's quite important not to stub your toe during the final phases
of touchdown.

HOUSTON: We copy you down, Eagle.

EAGLE: Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed!
<br><br>
HOUSTON: Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground.
You've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing
again. Thanks a lot.
<br><br>
TRANQUILITY: Thank you . . . That may have seemed like a
very long final phase. The auto targeting was taking us right
into a football-field-sized crater, with a large number of big
boulders and rocks for about one or two crater-diameters around
it, and it required flying manually over the rock field to find a
reasonably good area.
<br><br>
HOUSTON: Roger, we copy. It was beautiful from here,
Tranquility. Over.
<br><br>
TRANQUILITY: We'll get to the details of what's around here,
but it looks like a collection of just about every variety of
shape, angularity, granularity, about every variety of rock you
could find.
<br><br>
HOUSTON: Roger, Tranquility. Be advised there's lots of
smiling faces in this room, and all over the world.
<br><br>
TRANQUILITY: There are two of them up here.
<br><br>
COLUMBIA: And don't forget one in the command module.
<br><br>
ARMSTRONG: Once [we] settled on the surface, the dust
settled immediately and we had an excellent view of the area
surrounding the LM. We saw a crater surface, pockmarked with
craters up to 15, 20, 30 feet, and many smaller craters down to a
diameter of 1 foot and, of course, the surface was very fine-
grained. There were a surprising number of rocks of all sizes.

Leaving the ninth step of the ladder, 
Aldrin jumps down to the
Moon. Earlier on the "porch" he
had radioed, "Now I want to partially 
close the hatch, making sure
not to lock it on my way out."
Armstrong's dry response was: "A
good thought." On Earth his
weight, including the spacesuit
and mechanism-filled portable life-support 
system, would have totaled 360 lb; 
but here the gross
came only to a bouncy 60 lb. The
descent-engine exhaust bell (extreme right) 
came to rest about a
foot above the surface.
</table>

<br>

A number of experts had, prior to the flight, predicted that
a good bit of difficulty might be encountered by people due to
the variety of strange atmospheric and gravitational
characteristics. This didn't prove to be the case and after
landing we felt very comfortable in the lunar gravity. It was, in
fact, in our view preferable both to weightlessness and to the
Earth's gravity.
<br><br>
When we actually descended the ladder it was found to be
very much like the lunar-gravity simulations we had performed
here on Earth. No difficulty was encountered in descending the
ladder. The last step was about 3 1/2 feet from the surface, and
we were somewhat concerned that we might have difficulty in
reentering the LM at the end of our activity period. So we
practiced that before bringing the camera down.

ALDRIN: We opened the hatch and Neil, with me as his
navigator, began backing out of the tiny opening. It seemed like
a small eternity before I heard Neil say, "That's one small step
for man . . . one giant leap for mankind." In less than fifteen
minutes I was backing awkwardly out of the hatch and onto the
surface to join Neil, who, in the tradition of all tourists, had
his camera ready to photograph my arrival.

I felt buoyant and full of goose pimples when I stepped down
on the surface. I immediately looked down at my feet and became
intrigued with the peculiar properties of the lunar dust. If one
kicks sand on a beach, it scatters in numerous directions with
some grains traveling farther than others. On the Moon the dust
travels exactly and precisely as it goes in various directions,
and every grain of it lands nearly the same distance away.

<h3>THE BOY IN THE CANDY STORE</h3>

ARMSTRONG: There were a lot of things to do, and we had a
hard time getting, them finished. We had very little trouble,
much less trouble than expected, on the surface. It was a
pleasant operation. Temperatures weren't high. They were very
comfortable. The little EMU, the combination of spacesuit and
backpack that sustained our life on the surface, operated
magnificently. The primary difficulty was just far too little
time to do the variety of things we would have liked. We had the
problem of the five-year-old boy in a candy store.
<br><br>
ALDRIN: I took off jogging to test my maneuverability. The
exercise gave me an odd sensation and looked even more odd when I
later saw the films of it. With bulky suits on, we seemed to be
moving in slow motion. I noticed immediately that my inertia
seemed much greater. Earth-bound, I would have stopped my run in
just one step, but I had to use three of four steps to sort of
wind down. My Earth weight, with the big backpack and heavy suit,
was 360 pounds. On the Moon I weighed only 60 pounds.
<br><br>
At one point I remarked that the surface was "Beautiful,
beautiful. Magnificent desolation." I was struck by the contrast
between the starkness of the shadows and the desert-like
barrenness of the rest of the surface. It ranged from dusty gray
to light tan and was unchanging except for one startling sight:
our LM sitting there with its black, silver, and bright yellow-
orange thermal coating shining brightly in the otherwise
colorless landscape. I had seen Neil in his suit thousands of
times before, but on the Moon the unnatural whiteness of it
seemed unusually brilliant. We could also look around and see the
Earth, which, though much larger than the Moon the Earth was
seeing, seemed small - a beckoning oasis shining far away in the
sky.
<br><br>
As the sequence of lunar operations evolved, Neil had the
camera most of the time, and the majority of pictures taken on
the Moon that include an astronaut are of me. It wasn't until we
were back on Earth and in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory looking
over the pictures that we realized there were few pictures of
Neil. My fault perhaps, but we had never simulated this in our
training.

<h3>COAXING THE FLAG TO STAND</h3>

During a pause in experiments, Neil suggested we proceed
with the flag. It took both of us to set it up and it was nearly
a disaster. Public Relations obviously needs practice just as
everything else does. A small telescoping arm was attached to the
flagpole to keep the flag extended and perpendicular. As hard as
we tried, the telescope wouldn't fully extend. Thus the flags
which should have been flat, had its own unique permanent wave.
Then to our dismay the staff of the pole wouldn't go far enough
into the lunar surface to support itself in an upright position.
After much struggling we finally coaxed it to remain upright, but
in a most precarious position. I dreaded the possibility of the
American flag collapsing into the lunar dust in front of the
television camera.
<br><br>
COLLINS: [On his fourth orbital pass above] "How's it
going?" "The EVA is progressing beautifully. I believe they're
setting up the flag now." Just let things keep going that way,
and no surprises, please. Neil and Buzz sound good, with no
huffing and puffing to indicate they are overexerting themselves.
But one surprise at least is in store. Houston comes on the air,
not the slightest bit ruffled, and announces that the President
of the United States would like to talk to Neil and Buzz. "That
would be an honor," says Neil, with characteristic dignity.
<br><br>
The President's voice smoothly fills the air waves with the
unaccustomed cadence of the speechmaker, trained to convey
inspiration, or at least emotion, instead of our usual diet of
numbers and reminders. "Neil and Buzz, I am talking to you by
telephone from the Oval Office at the White House, and this
certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever
made . . . Because of what you have done, the heavens have become
a part of man's world. As you talk to us from the Sea of
Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring
peace and tranquility to Earth . . ." My God, I never thought of
all this bringing peace and tranquility to anyone. As far as I am
concerned, this voyage is fraught with hazards for the three of
us- and especially two of us- and that is about as far as I have
gotten in my thinking.
<br><br>
Neil, however, pauses long enough to give as well as he
receives. "It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here,
representing not only the United States but men of peace of all
nations, and with interest and a curiosity and a vision for the
future."

[Later] Houston cuts off the White House and returns to
business as usual, with a long string of numbers for me to copy
for future use. My God, the juxtaposition of the incongruous:
roll, pitch, and yaw; prayers, peace, and tranquility. What will
it be like if we really carry this off and return to Earth in one
piece, with our boxes full of rocks and our heads full of new
perspectives for the planet? I have a little time to ponder this
as I zing off out of sight of the White House and the Earth.
<br><br>
ALDRIN: We had a pulley system to load on the boxes of
rocks. We found the process more time-consuming and dust-scattering 
than anticipated. After the gear and both of us were
inside, our first chore was to pressure the LM cabin and begin
stowing the rock boxes, film magazines, and anything else we
wouldn't need until we were connected once again with the
Columbia. We removed our boots and the big backpacks, opened the
LM hatch, and threw these items onto the lunar surface, along
with a bagful of empty food packages and the LM urine bags. The
exact moment we tossed every thing out was measured back on
Earth- the seismometer we had put out was even more sensitive
than we had expected.

Before beginning liftoff procedures [we] settled down for
our fitful rest. We didn't sleep much at all. Among other things
we were elated- and also cold. Liftoff from the Moon, after a
stay totaling twenty-one hours, was exactly on schedule and
fairly uneventful. The ascent stage of the LM separated, sending
out a shower of brilliant insulation particles which had been
ripped off from the thrust of the ascent engine. There was no
lime to sightsee. I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil
was studying the attitude indicator, but I looked up long enough
to see the flag fall over . . . Three hours and ten minutes later
we were connected once again with the Columbia.
<br><br>
COLLINS: I can look out through my docking reticle and see
that they are steady as a rock as they drive down the center line
of that final approach path. I give them some numbers. "I have
0.7 mile and I got you at 31 feet per second." We really are
going to carry this off' For the first time since I was assigned
to this incredible flight, I feel that it is going to happen.
Granted, we are a long way from home, but from here on it should
be all downhill. Within a few seconds Houston joins the
conversation, with a tentative little call. "Eagle and Columbia,
Houston standing by." They want to know what the hell is going
on, but they don't want to interrupt us if we are in a crucial
spot in our final maneuvering. Good heads! However, they needn't
worry, and Neil lets them know it. "Roger, we're stationkeeping."

[After docking] it's time to hustle down into the tunnel and
remove hatch, probe, and drogue, so Neil and Buzz can get
through. Thank God, all the claptrap works beautifully in this
its final workout. The probe and drogue will stay with the LM and
be abandoned with it, for we will have no further need of them
and don't want them cluttering up the command module. The first
one through is Buzz, with a big smile on his face. I grab his
head, a hand on each temple, and am about to give him a smooch on
the forehead, as a parent might greet an errant child; but then,
embarrassed, I think better of it and grab his hand, and then
Neil's. We cavort about a little bit, all smiles and giggles over
our success, and then it's back to work as usual.

Excerpts from a TV program broadcast by the Apollo 11 astronauts 
on the last
evening of the flight, the day before splashdown in the Pacific:
</i>
<br><br>
COLLINS: ". . . The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is
an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of
which worked flawlessly. This computer above my head has a
38,000-word vocabulary, each word of which has been carefully
chosen to be of the utmost value to us. The SPS engine, our large
rocket engine on the aft end of our service module, must have
performed flawlessly or we would have been stranded in lunar
orbit. The parachutes up above my head must work perfectly
tomorrow or we will plummet into the ocean. We have always had
confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is
possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of
people. First, the American workmen who put these pieces of
machinery together in the factory. Second, the painstaking work
done by various test teams during the assembly and retest after
assembly. And finally, the people at the Manned Spacecraft
Center, both in management, in mission planning, in flight
control, and last but not least, in crew training. This operation
is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine. All you see is the
three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands
of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, 'Thank you

ALDRIN: ". . . This has been far more than three men on a
mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a
government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one
nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable
curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. Today I feel
we're really fully capable of accepting expanded roles in the
exploration of space. In retrospect, we have all been
particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously
chose for our spacecraft, Columbia and Eagle. We've been pleased
with the emblem of our flight, the eagle carrying an olive
branch, bringing the universal symbol of peace from the planet
Earth to the Moon. Personally, in reflecting on the events of the
past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. 'When I
consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the
stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art
mindful of him?'"
<br><br>
ARMSTRONG: "The responsibility for this flight lies first
with history and with the giants of science who have preceded
this effort; next with the American people, who have, through
their will, indicated their desire; next with four
administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will;
and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our
spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little
EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out
on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all
those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the
construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all
their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we
give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are
listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from
Apollo 11."

A third spacecraft, Lunar Orbiter III, made
the pinpoint landing possible by its earlier feat 
of photographing the site in exquisite detail.
</table>

<br><br>
<i>
Scientific exploration of the Moon began in earnest with the
Apollo 12 and 14 missions. Four astronauts worked on the Moon in
four-hour shifts, walking from site to site. The Apollo 12
astronauts carried everything: experiments, equipment, tools,
sample hags, cameras. The Apollo 14 team had a small equipment
cart, and some of the time it was a help. But the missions showed
that a man in a pressurized suit had definite limitations on the
rugged and perplexing lunar surface. It was more work than it
seemed, and in the case of Apollo 14, medical advice from Earth
ended one phase of activity. But the two missions produced a
wealth of new scientific data and lunar samples, and both laid a
firm foundation for the great voyages of lunar exploration to
follow.
<br><br>
The sky was cloudy and rain was falling on November 14,
1969, as the Apollo 12 crew prepared for launch. Half a minute
after liftoff a lightning strike opened the main circuit breakers
in the spacecraft. Quick action by the crew and Launch Control
restored power, and Astronauts Charles "Pete" Conrad, Jr.,
Richard F. Gordon, and Alan L. Bean sped into sunlight above the
clouds. "We had everything in the world drop out", Conrad
reported. "We've had a couple of cardiac arrests down here too",
Launch Control radioed back.
<br><br>
Their destination was the Ocean of Storms. Four and a half
days later, Conrad and Bean entered the lunar module Intrepid and
separated from Gordon in the command module Yankee Clipper. Their
landing site was about 1300 miles west of where Apollo 11 had
landed, on a surface believed covered by debris splashed out from
the crater Copernicus some 250 miles away. The exact site was a
point where, 31 months before, the unmanned lunar scout Surveyor
III had made a precarious automatic landing. The Surveyor site
was a natural choice: it was a geologically different surface, it
would demonstrate pinpoint landing precision, and it would offer
a chance to bring back metal, electronic, and optical materials
that had soaked for many months in the lunar environment.
<br><br>
Here is Pete Conrad's account of the mission:
</i>
<br><br>
It was really pioneering in lunar exploration. We had
planned our traverses carefully, we covered them, and we stayed
on the time line. We had a real-time link with the ground, to
help guide our work on the surface. Of course we had practiced a
lot beforehand. working with geologists in the field to learn
techniques from them while they learned what we could and
couldn't do in the lunar environment.
<br><br>
Our first important task was the precision landing near
Surveyor III. When we pitched over just before the landing phase,
there it was, looking as if we would land practically on target.
The targeting data were just about perfect, but I maneuvered
around the crater, landing at a slightly different spot than the
one we had planned. In my judgment, the place we had prepicked
was a little too rough. We touched down about 600 feet from the
Surveyor. They didn't want us to be nearer than 500 feet because
of the risk that the descent engine might blow dust over the
spacecraft.
<br><br>
Our second important task- and of course the real reason for
going to the Moon in the first place- was to accomplish useful
scientific work on the surface. We had to set up the ALSEP and
its experiments; we had to do a lot of geologizing; and finally
we had to bring back some pieces of the Surveyor, so they could
be analyzed for the effects of their exposure.
<br><br>
Al Bean and I made two EVAs, each lasting just under four
hours; and we covered the planned traverses as scheduled. We
learned things that we could never have found out in a
simulation. A simple thing like shoveling soil into a sample bag,
for instance, was an entirely new experience. First, you had to
handle the shovel differently, stopping it before you would have
on Earth, and tilting it to dump the load much more steeply,
after which the whole sample would slide off suddenly.

<h3>LITTLE CLOUDS AROUND YOUR FEET</h3>

And the dust! Dust got into everything. You walked in a pair
of little dust clouds kicked up around your feet. We were
concerned about getting dust into the working parts of the
spacesuits and into the lunar module, so we elected to remain in
the suits between our two EVAs. We thought that it would be less
risky that way than taking them off and putting them back on
again.
<br><br>
On the first EVA, the first thing I did was to take the
contingency sample. When Al joined me on the surface, we started
with the experimental setups. We set out the solar wind
experiment and the ALSEP items. We planted the passive seismic
experiment, deployed and aligned antennas, laid out the lunar
surface magnetometer, and took core samples. Some of the
experiments started working right away as planned, sending data
back. Others weren't set to start operating until after we had
left.
<br><br>
We were continually describing what we were doing; we kept
up a stream of chatter so that people on the ground could follow
what was going on if we were to lose the video signal. And we did
lose it, too, soon after we landed. That was hard to take.

One strange surface phenomenon was a group of conical
mounds, looking for all the world like small volcanoes. They were
maybe five feet tall and about fifteen feet in diameter at the
base. Both of us really enjoyed working on the surface; we took a
lot of kidding later about the way we reacted. But it was
exciting; there we were, the third and fourth people on the Moon,
doing what we were supposed to do, what we had planned to do, and
keeping within schedule. Add to that the excitement of just being
there, and I think we could be forgiven for reacting with
enthusiasm.

Our second EVA was heavily scheduled. We were to make visual
observations, collect a lot more samples, document
photographically the area around the Ocean of Storms, and- if we
could- bring back pieces of the Surveyor III spacecraft. We had
rehearsed that part with a very detailed mockup before the
flight, and were well prepared.
<br><br>
We moved on a traverse, picking up samples and describing
them and the terrain around them, as well as documenting the
specific sites with photography. We rolled a rock into a crater
so that scientists back on Earth could sec if the seismic
experiment was working. (It was sensitive enough to pick up my
steps as I walked nearby.) Anyway, we rolled the rock and they
got a jiggle or two, indicating that experiment was off and
running.

<h3>TAN DUST ON SURVEYOR</h3>

We found some green rocks, and some gray soil that
maintained its light color even below the surface, which is not
common, and we finally reached the Surveyor crater. I was
surprised by its size and its hard surface. We could have landed
right there, I believe now, but it would have been a scary thing
at the time. The Surveyor was covered with a coating of fine
dust, and it looked tan or even brown in the lunar light, instead
of the glistening white that it was when it left Earth more than
two years earlier. It was decided later that the dust was kicked
up by our descent onto the surface, even though we were 600 feet
away.
<br><br>
We cut samples of the aluminum tubing, which seemed more
brittle than the same material on Earth, and some electrical
cables. Their insulation seemed to have gotten dry, hard, and
brittle. We managed to break off a piece of glass, and we
unbolted the Surveyor TV camera. Then Al suggested that we cut
off and take back the sampling scoop, and so we added that to the
collection.
<br><br>
Then we headed back to the Intrepid. We retrieved the solar-
wind experiment, stowed it and the sample bags in the Intrepid,
got in, buttoned it up, and started repressurization. Altogether
we brought back about 75 pounds of rocks, and 15 pounds of
Surveyor hardware. We also brought back the 25-pound color TV
camera from Intrepid so that its failure could be investigated.
<br><br>
While we were busy on the surface, Dick Gordon was busy in
lunar orbit. The Yankee Clipper was a very sophisticated
observation and surveying spacecraft. One of the experiments that
Dick performed was multispectral photography of the lunar
surface, which gave scientists new data with which to interpret
the composition of the Moon.
<br><br>
After Al and I got back to Yankee Clipper following lunar
liftoff and rendezvous, all three of us worked on the photography
schedule. We were looking specifically for good coverage of
proposed future landing sites, especially Fra Mauro, which was
then scheduled for Apollo 13. That's a rough surface, and we
wanted to get the highest resolution photos we could so that the
crew of the Apollo 13 mission would have the best training
information they could get.
<br><br>
We changed the plane of our lunar orbit to cover the sites
better, and we also elected to stay an extra day in lunar orbit
so that we could complete the work without feeling pressured. We
took hundreds of stills, and thousands of feet of motion-picture
film of the Fra Mauro site, and of the Descartes and Lalande
craters, two other proposed landing sites.
<br><br>
Meantime the experiments we had left on the lunar surface
were busy recording and transmitting data. They all worked well,
with one exception, and were really producing useful data. One
unexpected result came from the seismic experiment recording the
impact of Intrepid on the surface after we had jettisoned it. The
entire Moon rang like a gong, vibrating and resonating for almost
on hour after the impact. The best guess was that the Moon was
composed of rubble a lot deeper below its surface than anybody
had assumed. The internal structure, being fractured instead of a
solid mass, could bounce the seismic energy from piece to piece
for quite a while.
<br><br>
The same phenomenon was observed at two ALSEP stations when
the Apollo 14 crew jettisoned their lunar module Antares and
programmed it to crash between the Apollo 12 and 14 sites.
<br><br>
With every mission after Apollo 12, additional seismic
calibrations were obtained by aiming the Saturn S-IVB stage to
impact a selected point on the Moon after separation from the
spacecraft. The seismic vibrations from these impacts lasted
about three hours.

Color telecasts, live from the Apollo 14 site, 
came by way of the erectable S-band antenna
shown here. The S-band of radio frequencies 
(between 1550 and 5200 megahertz) was used for
high-data-rate space transmissions. The 
gold-colored parabolic reflector, which opened just like
an umbrella, provided a higher gain than 
the lunar module's own steerable antenna. Note how
featureless the lunar surface appears in 
the area just above the astronaut's shadow. This illustrates 
the visibility problem that the astronauts 
faced in walking down-Sun.

<br>

Apollo 13 was supposed to land in the Fra Mauro area. The
explosion on board wiped out that mission, and it became instead
a superb example of a crew's ability to turn a very risky
situation into a safe return to Earth.
<br><br>
So the Fra Mauro site was reassigned to Apollo 14, because
scientists gave that area a high priority. The following account
is by Alan B. Shepard, Jr., the first American into space and of
the original seven astronauts.
<br><br>
The Fra Mauro hills stand a couple of hundred of miles to
the cast of the Apollo 12 landing site. I was selected to command
this mission, my first since the original Mercury flight in 1961.
With me to the lunar surface went Edgar D. Mitchell in Antares,
while Stuart A. Roosa was the command module pilot of Kitty Hawk.

The targeting data for the Apollo 14 landing site were every
bit as good as the data for Apollo 12; but we had to fly around
for a little while for the same reason they had to. The landing
site was rougher, on direct observation, than the photos had been
able to show. So I looked for a smoother area, found one, and
landed there.
<br><br>
Our first EVA was similar to those before; we got out, set
up the solar-wind experiment and the flag, and deployed the
ALSEP. The latter had two new experiments. One was called the
"thumper." Ed Mitchell set up an array of geophones, and then
walked out along a planned survey line with a device that could
be placed against the surface and fired, to create a local impact
of known size. Thirteen of the 21 charges went off, registering
good results. The other different experiment we had was a grenade
launcher, with four grenades to be fired off by radio command
some time after we had left the Moon. They were designed to
impact at different distances from the launcher, to get a pattern
of seismic response to the impact explosions.
<br><br>
While Ed and I were working on our first EVA. Stu was doing
the photographic part of the orbital science experiments. One job
was to get detailed photographic coverage of the proposed site
for the Apollo 15 mission, near the Descartes crater.
<br><br>
He was asked also to get a number of other photos of the
lunar surface, in areas that had not been well-covered in earlier
missions. Stu produced some great photos of the surface, rotating
the command module Kitty Hawk to compensate for the motion of the
image. He photographed the area around Lansberg B, which had been
the predicted impact site of the Apollo 13 S-IVB stage. It was
calculated that the impact could have produced a crater about 200
feet in diameter, and scientists wanted good pictures of the area
so they could search for the brand-new crater on the Moon.
<br><br>
Stu also found them another new crater on the back side of
the Moon. It was serendipity; he was shooting other pictures and
suddenly this very bright, young crater came into view directly
under Kitty Hawk. So he swung the camera around, pushed the
button, and then went back to his original assignment.

<h3>A LUNAR RICKSHAW</h3>

Ed and I worked on the surface for 4 hours and 50 minutes
during our first EVA; after the return to Antares, a long rest
period, and then resulting, we began the second EVA. This time we
had the MET- modularized equipment transporter, although we
called it the lunar rickshaw- to carry tools, cameras, and
samples so we could work more effectively and bring back a larger
quantity of samples.
<br><br>

and boulders encountered are

emplaced experiments. Such maps
are essential for an understanding of
the sample sources and the experiment 
data.
</table>
</center>
<br>

Our planned traverse was to take us from Antares more or
less due east to the rim of Cone crater. That traverse had been
chosen because scientists wanted samples and rocks from the
crater's rim. The theory is that the oldest rocks from deep under
the Moon's surface were thrown up and out of the crater by the
impact, and that the ones from the extreme depth of the crater
were to be found on the rim.
<br><br>
On our way to the crater, one of the first things Ed did was
to take a magnetometer reading at the first designated site. When
he read the numbers over the air, there was some excitement back
at Houston because the readings were about triple the values
gotten on Apollo 12. They were also higher than the values Stu
was reading in the Kitty Hawk, and so it seemed that the Moon's
magnetic field varied spatially.
<br><br>

<td valign=bottom><font size=2>
The well-stocked tool rack at left,
which fitted neatly on the rickshaw,
was at least better than traipsing
about carrying everything, including
samples already collected. But it
proved to be a drag in deep dust,
easier to carry than to tow. The
problem of doing on-the-spot lunar
geologising in an efficient way
awaited the electric Rover.
</table>
</center>
<br>

Our first sampling began a little further on, in a rock
field with boulders about two or three feet along the major
dimension. These were located in the centers of a group of three
craters, each about sixty feet across. Like the bulk of the
samples brought back, these were documented samples. That means
photographing the soil or rocks, describing them and their
position over the voice link to Mission Control, and then putting
the sample in a numbered bag, identifying the bag at the same
time on the voice hookup.
<br><br>
Apollo 14 tried an experiment to do something constructive
about the dust that plagued all of the missions. NASA engineers
wanted to check out some of the finishes proposed for the Rover
and other pieces of operating equipment. I had a group of
samples - material chips with different finishes - and I dusted
them with the surface dust, shook them off, and then brushed one
set to try to determine the abrasive effects, if any, of such
dust removal. The other set was left unbrushed as a control
sample. All this was of course recorded with the closeup camera.
<br><br>
The mapped traverse was to take us nearly directly to the
rim of Cone crater, a feature about 1000 feet in diameter. As we
approached. the boulders got larger, up to four and five feet in
size. And at this time, the going started to get rough for us.
The terrain became more steep as we approached the rim, and the
increased grade accentuated the difficulty of walking in soft
dust.

<h3>THE HUNT FOR THE RIM OF CONE</h3>

Another problem was that the ruggedness and unevenness of
the terrain made it very hard to navigate by landmarks, which is
the way a man on foot gets around. Ed and I had difficulty in
agreeing on the way to Cone, just how far we had traveled, and
where we were. We did some more sampling. and then moved on
toward Cone, into terrain that had almost continuous undulations,
and very small flat areas. Soon after that, the surface began to
slope upward even more steeply, and it gave us the feeling that
we were starting the last climb to the rim of Cone. We passed a
rock which had a lot of glass in it, and reported to Houston that
it was too big to pick up.
<br><br>
We continued, changing our suit cooling rated to match our
increased work output as we climbed. and stopping a couple of
times briefly to rest. For a while, we picked up the cart and
carried it, preferring to move this way because it was a little
faster.
<br><br>

</table>
</center>
<br>

And then came what had to be one of the most frustrating
experiences on the traverse. We thought we were nearing the rim
of Cone, only to find we were at another and much smaller crater
still some distance from Cone. At that point, I radioed Houston
that our positions were doubtful, and that there was probably
quite a way to go yet to reach Cone.
<br><br>
About then, there was a general concurrence that maybe that
was about as far as we should go, even though Ed protested that
we really ought to press on and look into Cone crater. But in the
end, we stopped our traverse short of the lip and turned for the
walk back to Antares.
<br><br>
Later estimates indicated we were perhaps only 30 feet or so
below the rim of the crater, and yet we were just not able to
define it in that undulating and rough country.
<br><br>
One of the rocks we sampled in that area was a white breccia
(a rock made up of pieces of stone embedded in a matrix). The
white coloring came from the very high percentage of feldspar
that was in the breccia. That rock, and others in the area, were
believed to approach 4.6 billion years in age.

will continue for years at a slowly diminishing rate.
</table>
</center>
<br>

We stopped at Weird crater, for more sampling and some
panoramic photography, and then continued the return traverse. At
the Triplet craters, more than three-quarters of the way back to
Antares, we stopped again. Ed's job there was to drive some core
tubes; I was to dig a trench to check the stratification of the
surface. But the core material was granular and slipped out of
the tube every time Ed lifted it clear of the surface. I wasn't
having any better luck with my trenching, because the side walls
kept collapsing. I did get enough of a trench dug so that I could
observe some stratification of the surface materials, seeing
their color shift into the darker browns and near blacks, and
then into a surprisingly light-colored layer underneath the
darkest one.
<br><br>
That was it, Antares was in sight, as it had been throughout
much of the traverse, and our long Moon walk was almost over. I
went on past Antares to the ALSEP site to check antenna alignment
because of reports from Houston that a weak signal was being
received. Ed took some more samples from a nearby field of
boulders.

At that, our surface tasks were done, with the exception of
recovering the solar-wind experiment and getting back into
Antares for the return flight. We had covered a distance of about
two miles and collected many samples during four and one-half
hours on the surface in the second EVA. I also threw a makeshift

<br>

After liftoff there were still experiments left to do. The
first of these was another seismic event, generated by the impact
of the jettisoned Antares on the Moon. Again the Moon responded
with that resonant ringing for some time after the event. Once we
were on our way back to Earth, we did a series of four
experiments in weightlessness. One was a simple metal casting
experiment, to see what the effects of zero gravity would be on
the purity or the homogeneity of the mass. The materials included
some pure samples, and others with crystals or fibers for
strengthening. As you might expect, the materials turned out to
be more homogeneous under zero-gravity conditions. We measured
heat flow and convection in some samples and, sure enough, zero
gravity changed those characteristics also. We did some
electrophoretic separations, which are techniques used by the
pharmaceutical industry to make vaccines, in the belief that
maybe zero-gravity conditions could simplify a complex and
expensive process. Finally, we did some fluid transfer
experiments, simply trying to pour a fluid from one container to
another in zero gravity. The surface tension works against you
there, and so it was much easier when the containers being used
were equipped with baffles that the fluid could cling to, as it
were.

That was our mission. Our return was routine, our landing on

I look back now on the flights carrying Pete's crew and my
crew as the real pioneering explorations of the Moon. Neil, Buzz,
and Mike in Apollo 11 proved that man could get to the Moon and
do useful scientific work, once he was there. Our two flights-
Apollo 12 and 14- proved that scientists could select a target
area and define a series of objectives, and that man could get
there with precision and carry out the objectives with relative
ease and a very high degree of success. And both of our flights.
as did earlier and later missions, pointed up the advantage of
manned space exploration. We all were able to make minor
corrections or major changes at times when they were needed,
sometimes for better efficiency, and sometimes to save the
mission.

the lunar dust stuck to their suits almost up to their knees.

Apollo 12 and 14 were the transition missions. After us came
the lunar rover, wheels to extend greatly the distance of the
traverse and the quantity of samples that could be carried back
to the lunar module. And on the last flight, a trained scientist
who was also an astronaut went along on the mission.

I'd like to look on that last flight as just a temporary

by the fact that all of the study material comes 
from one planet. Although meteorites are fascinating 
samples of the material of the solar system at large, 
there is never any direct evidence of the
source of an individual meteorite. Now, within a few 
years, mankind has assembled the material
of another world, recording where each piece

<h3>ALSEP: Scientific Station on the Moon</h3>

Although the Apollo astronauts could stay on the lunar surface
for only a few days, scientists wished to make some kinds of
observations over a period of weeks or even years, if possible.
The solution was to have the astronauts set up an unmanned,
automatic scientific station called ALSEP (Apollo Lunar Surface
Experiments Package). An ALSEP was emplaced at each landing
site, beginning with Apollo 12.
<br><br>

<table border=0 width=70%><tr><td>&nbsp;<tr><td align=center><font size=2>
An ALSEP is a group of geophysical instruments arrayed about
a central station, as in the accompanying sketch. Each ALSEP
has a different set of experiments. 
Power is supplied by a Radioisotope 
Thermoelectric Generator. Radio communication for the
transmission of experiment data and the receipt of instrument
adjustment commands is maintained through a rod-shaped
antenna pointed in the Earth's general direction.
</table>
</center>
<br>

Each ALSEP can send about 9 million instrument readings a
day. With five ALSEPs operating simultaneously, a staggering
amount of information has already accumulated. An unexpected
bonus has been the unusually long lifetimes of the ALSEP units.
Originally designed for one year of reliable operation, all were
still sending useful data five years after Apollo 12.

Since Apollo 13 many people have asked me, "Did you have
suicide pills on board?" We didn't, and I never heard of such a
thing in the eleven years I spent as an astronaut and NASA
executive.
<br><br>
I did, of course, occasionally think of the possibility that
the spacecraft explosion might maroon us in an enormous orbit
about the Earth - a sort of perpetual monument to the space
program. But Jack Swigert, Fred Haise, and I never talked about
that fate during our perilous flight. I guess we were too busy
struggling for survival.
<br><br>
Survive we did, but it was close. Our mission was a failure
but I like to think it was a successful failure.

Apollo 13, scheduled to be the third lunar landing, was
launched at 1313 Houston time on Saturday, April 11, 1970; I had
never felt more confident. On my three previous missions, I had
already logged 572 hours in space, beginning with Gemini 7, when
Frank Borman and I stayed up 14 days- a record not equaled until
Skylab.
<br><br>
Looking back, I realize I should have been alerted by
several omens that occurred in the final stages of the Apollo 13
preparation. First, our command module pilot, Ken Mattingly, with
whom Haise and I had trained for nearly two years, turned out to
have no immunity to German measles (a minor disease the backup LM
pilot, Charlie Duke, had inadvertently exposed us to). I argued
to keep Ken, who was one of the most conscientious, hardest
working of all the astronauts. In my argument to Dr. Paine, the
NASA Administrator, I said, "Measles aren't that bad, and if Ken
came down with them, it would be on the way home, which is a
quiet part of the mission. From my experience as command module
pilot on Apollo 8, I know Fred and I could bring the spacecraft
home alone if we had to." Besides, I said, Ken doesn't have the
measles now, and he may never get them. (Five years later, he
still hadn't.)
<br><br>
Dr. Paine said no, the risk was too great. So I said in that
case we'll be happy to accept Jack Swigert, the backup CMP, a
good man (as indeed he proved to be, though he had only two days
of prime-crew training).
<br><br>
The second omen came in ground tests before launch, which
indicated the possibility of a poorly insulated supercritical
helium tank in the LM's descent stage. So we modified the flight
plan to enter the LM three hours early, in order to obtain an
onboard readout of helium tank pressure. This proved to be lucky
for us because it gave us a chance to shake down this odd-shaped
spacecraft that was to hold our destiny in its spidery hands. It
also meant the LM controllers were in Mission Control when they
would be needed most.
<br><br>
Then there was the No. 2 oxygen tank, serial number 10024X-TA0009. 
This tank had been installed in the service module of
Apollo 10, but was removed for modification (and was damaged in
the process of removal). I have to congratulate Tom Stafford,
John Young, and Gene Cernan, the lucky dogs, for getting rid of
it.
<br><br>
This tank was fixed, tested at the factory, installed in our
service module. and tested again during the Countdown
Demonstration Test at the Kennedy Space Center beginning March
16, 1970. The tanks normally are emptied to about half full, and
No. 1 behaved all right. But No. 2 dropped to only 92 percent of
capacity. Gaseous oxygen at 80 psi was applied through the vent
line to expel the liquid oxygen, but to no avail. An interim
discrepancy report was written, and on March 27, two weeks before
launch, detanking operations were resumed. No. 1 again emptied
normally, but its idiot twin did not. After a conference with
contractor and NASA personnel, the test director decided to "boil
off" the remaining oxygen in No. 2 by using the electrical heater
within the tank. The technique worked, but it took eight hours of
65-volt DC power from the ground-support equipment to dissipate
the oxygen.
<br><br>
With the wisdom of hindsight, I should have said, "Hold it.
Wait a second. I'm riding on this spacecraft. Just go out and
replace that tank." But the truth is, I went along, and I must
share the responsibility with many, many others for the $375
million failure of Apollo 13. On just about every spaceflight we
have had some sort of failure, but in this case, it was an
accumulation of human errors and technical anomalies that doomed
Apollo 13.
<br><br>
At five and a half minutes after liftoff, Swigert, Haise,
and I felt a little vibration. Then the center engine of the S-II
stage shut down two minutes early. This caused the remaining four
engines to burn 34 seconds longer than planned, and the S-IVB
third stage had to burn nine seconds longer to put us in orbit.
No problem: the S-IVB had plenty of fuel.
<br><br>
The first two days we ran into a couple of minor surprises,
but generally Apollo 13 was looking like the smoothest flight of
the program. At 46 hours 43 minutes Joe Kerwin, the CapCom on
duty, said, "The spacecraft is in real good shape as far as we
are concerned. We're bored to tears down here." It was the last
time anyone would mention boredom for a long time.
<br><br>
At 55 hours 46 minutes, as we finished a 49-minute TV
broadcast showing how comfortably we lived and worked in
weightlessness, I pronounced the benediction: "This is the crew
of Apollo 13 wishing everybody there a nice evening, and we're
just about ready to close out our inspection of Aquarius (the LM)
and get back for a pleasant evening in Odyssey (the CM). Good
night."
<br><br>
On the tapes I sound mellow and benign, or some might say
fat, dumb, and happy. A pleasant evening, indeed! Nine minutes
later the roof fell in; rather, oxygen tank No. 2 blew up,
causing No. 1 tank also to fail. We came to the slow conclusion
that our normal supply of electricity, light, and water was lost,
and we were about 200,000 miles from Earth. We did not even have
power to gimbal the engine so we could begin an immediate return
to Earth.
<br><br>
The message came in the form of a sharp bang and vibration.
Jack Swigert saw a warning light that accompanied the bang, and
said, "Houston, we've had a problem here." I came on and told the
ground that it was a main B bus undervolt. The time was 2108
hours on April 13.
<br><br>
Next, the warning lights told us we had lost two of our
three fuel cells, which were our prime source of electricity. Our
first thoughts were ones of disappointment, since mission rules
forbade a lunar landing with only one fuel cell.
<br><br>
With warning lights blinking on, I checked our situation;
the quantity and pressure gages for the two oxygen tanks gave me
cause for concern. One tank appeared to be completely empty, and
there were indications that the oxygen in the second tank was
rapidly being depleted. Were these just instrument malfunctions?
I was soon to find out.
<br><br>
Thirteen minutes after the explosion, I happened to look out
of the left-hand window, and saw the final evidence pointing
toward potential catastrophe. "We are venting something out into
the- into space," I reported to Houston. Jack Lousma, the CapCom
replied, "Roger, we copy you venting." I said, "It's a gas of
some sort."
<br><br>
It was a gas-oxygen-escaping at a high rate from our
second, and last, oxygen tank. I am told that some amateur
astronomers on top of a building in Houston could actually see
the expanding sphere of gas around the spacecraft.

<h3>ARRANGING FOR SURVIVAL</h3>

The knot tightened in my stomach, and all regrets about not
landing on the Moon vanished. Now it was strictly a case of
survival.

The first thing we did, even before we discovered the oxygen
leak, was to try to close the hatch between the CM and the LM. We
reacted spontaneously, like submarine crews, closing the hatches
to limit the amount of flooding. First Jack and then I tried to
lock the reluctant hatch, but the stubborn lid wouldn't stay
shut! Exasperated, and realizing that we didn't have a cabin
leak, we strapped the hatch to the CM couch.

In retrospect, it was a good thing that we kept the tunnel
open, because Fred and I would soon have to make a quick trip to
the LM in our fight for survival. It is interesting to note that
days later, just before we jettisoned the LM, when the hatch had
to be closed and locked, Jack did it - easy as pie. That's the
kind of flight it was.

"There's one whole side of that spacecraft missing," 
said Lovell in astonishment. About five hours before 
splashdown the service module was jettisoned 
in a manner that would permit the astronauts 
to assess its condition.  
Until then, nobody realized the extent of the damage.

Vital stores of oxygen, water, propellant, and 
power were lost when the side of the service 
module blew off. The astronauts quickly moved 
into the lunar module which had been provided 
with independent supplies of these space 
necessities for the landing on the Moon. 
Years before, Apollo engineers had talked of 
using the lunar module as a lifeboat.

<br>

The pressure in the No. 1 oxygen tank continued to drift
downward; passing 300 psi, now heading toward 200 psi. Months
later, after the accident investigation was complete, it was
determined that, when No. 2 tank blew up, it either ruptured a
line on the No. 1 tank, or caused one of the valves to leak. When
the pressure reached 200 psi, it was obvious that we were going
to lose all oxygen, which meant that the last fuel cell would
also die.

At 1 hour and 29 seconds after the bang, Jack Lousma, then
CapCom, said after instructions from Flight Director Glynn
Lunney: "It is slowly going to zero, and we are starting to think
about the LM lifeboat." Swigert replied, "That's what we have
been thinking about too."

A lot has been written about using the LM as a lifeboat
after the CM has become disabled. There are documents to prove
that the lifeboat theory was discussed just before the Lunar
Orbit Rendezvous mode was chosen in 1962. Other references go
back to 1963, but by 1964 a study at the Manned Spacecraft Center
concluded: "The LM [as lifeboat] . . . was finally dropped,
because no single reasonable CSM failure could be identified that
would prohibit use of the SPS." Naturally, I'm glad that view
didn't prevail, and I'm thankful that by the time of Apollo 10,
the first lunar mission carrying the LM, the LM as a lifeboat was
again being discussed. Fred Haise, fortunately, held the
reputation as the top astronaut expert on the LM- after spending
fourteen months at the Grumman plant on Long Island, where the LM
was built.

Fred says: "I never heard of the LM being used in the sense
that we used it. We had procedures, and we had trained to use it
as a backup propulsion device, the rationale being that the thing
we were really covering was the failure of the command module's
main engine, the SPS engine. In that case, we would have used
combinations of the LM descent engine, and in some cases, for
some lunar aborts, the ascent engine as well. But we never really
thought and planned, and obviously, we didn't have the procedures
to cover a case where the command module would end up fully
powered down."

To get Apollo 13 home would require a lot of innovation.
Most of the material written about our mission describes the
ground-based activities, and I certainly agree that without the
splendid people in Mission Control, and their backups, we'd still
be up there.
<br><br>
They faced a formidable task. Completely new procedures had
to be written and tested in the simulator before being passed up
to us. The navigation problem was also theirs; essentially how,
when, and in what attitude to burn the LM descent engine to
provide a quick return home. They were always aware of our
safety, as exemplified by the jury-rig fix of our environmental
system to reduce the carbon dioxide level.
<br><br>
However, I would be remiss not to state that it really was
the teamwork between the ground and flight crew that resulted in
a successful return. I was blessed with two shipmates who were
very knowledgeable about their spacecraft systems. and the
disabled service module forced me to relearn quickly how to
control spacecraft attitude from the LM, a task that became more
difficult when we turned off the attitude indicator.

<h3>FIFTEEN MINUTES OF POWER LEFT</h3>

With only 15 minutes of power left in the CM, CapCom told us
to make our way into the LM. Fred and I quickly floated through
the tunnel, leaving Jack to perform the last chores in our
forlorn and pitiful CM that had seemed such a happy home less
than two hours earlier. Fred said something that strikes me as
funny as I read it now: "Didn't think I'd be back so soon." But
nothing seemed funny in real time on that 13th of April, 1970.

Blast-gutted service module was set adrift from 
the combined command module and lunar module just four hours 
before Earth reentry. Mission Control had insisted on 
towing the wrecked service module for 300,000 miles 
because its bulk protected the command module's heat 
shield from the intense cold of space. The astronauts next 
revived the long-dormant command module and prepared 
to leave their lunar module lifeboat.
</table>
</center>
<br>

There were many, many things to do. In the first place, did
we have enough consumables to get home? Fred started calculating,
keeping in mind that the LM was built for only a 45-hour
lifetime, and we had to stretch that to 90. He had some data from
previous LMs in his book -- average rates of water usage related to
amperage level, rate of water needed for cooling. It turned out
that we had enough oxygen. The full LM descent tank alone would
suffice, and in addition, there were two ascent-engine oxygen
tanks, and two backpacks whose oxygen supply would never be used
on the lunar surface. Two emergency bottles on top of those packs
had six or seven pounds each in them. (At LM jettison, just
before reentry, 28.5 pounds of oxygen remained, more than half of
what we started with.)
<br><br>
We had 2181 ampere hours in the LM batteries. We thought
that was enough if we turned off every electrical power device
not absolutely necessary. We could not count on the precious CM
batteries, because they would be needed for reentry after the LM
was cast off. In fact, the ground carefully worked out a
procedure where we charged the CM batteries with LM power. As it
turned out, we reduced our energy consumption to a fifth of
normal, which resulted in our having 20 percent of our LM
electrical power left when we jettisoned Aquarius. We did have
one electrical heart-stopper during the mission. One of the CM
batteries vented with such force that it momentarily dropped off
the line. We knew we were finished if we permanently lost that
battery.

The jettisoning of elements during the critical 
last hours of the Apollo 13 mission is shown in this sequence 
drawing. When the lifesaving LM was shoved off by 
tunnel pressure about an hour before splashdown, everyone 
felt a surge of sentiment as the magnificent craft 
peeled away. Its maker, Grumman, later jokingly sent 
a bill for more than $400,000 to North American Rockwell 
for "towing" the CSM 300,000 miles.
</table>
</center>
<br>

Water was the real problem. Fred figured that we would run
out of water about five hours before we got back to Earth, which
was calculated at around 151 hours. But even there, Fred had an
ace in the hole. He knew we had a data point from Apollo 11,
which had not sent its LM ascent stage crashing into the Moon, as
subsequent missions did. An engineering test on the vehicle
showed that its mechanisms could survive seven or eight hours in
space without water cooling, until the guidance system rebelled
at this enforced toasting. But we did conserve water. We cut down
to six ounces each per day, a fifth of normal intake, and used
fruit juices; we ate hot dogs and other wet-pack foods when we
ate at all. (We lost hot water with the accident and dehydratable
food is not palatable with cold water.) Somehow, one doesn't get
very thirsty in space and we became quite dehydrated. I set one
record that stood up throughout Apollo: I lost fourteen pounds,
and our crew set another by losing a total of 31.5 pounds, nearly
50 percent more than any other crew. Those stringent measures
resulted in our finishing with 28.2 pounds of water, about 9
percent of the total.

Fred had figured that we had enough lithium hydroxide
canisters, which remove carbon dioxide from the spacecraft. There
were four cartridge from the LM, and four from the backpacks,
counting backups. But he forgot that there would be three of us
in the LM instead of the normal two. The LM was designed to
support two men for two days. Now it was being asked to care for
three men nearly four days.

<h3>A SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE</h3>

We would have died of the exhaust from our own lungs if
Mission Control hadn't come up with a marvelous fix. The trouble
was the square lithium hydroxide canisters from the CM would not
fit the round openings of those in the LM environmental system.
After a day and a half in the LM a warning light showed us that
the carbon dioxide had built up to a dangerous level, but the
ground was ready. They had thought up a way to attach a CM
canister to the LM system by using plastic bags, cardboard, and
tape- all materials we had on board. Jack and I put it together:
just like building a model airplane. The contraption wasn't very
handsome, but it worked. It was a great improvisation- and a fine
example of cooperation between ground and space.
<br><br>
The big question was, "How do we get back safely to Earth?"
The LM navigation system wasn't designed to help us in this
situation. Before the explosion, at 30 hours and 40 minutes, we
had made the normal midcourse correction, which would take us out
of a free-return-to-Earth trajectory and put us on our lunar
landing course. Now we had to get back on that free-return
course. The ground-computed 35-second burn, by an engine designed
to land us on the Moon, accomplished that objective 5 hours after
the explosion.
<br><br>

"Backroom" experts at Mission Control worked 
many hours to devise the fix that possibly kept the astronauts 
from dying of carbon dioxide. CapCom Joe Kerwin led 
Astronaut Swigert, step by step, for an hour to build a 
contraption like the one the experts had constructed on 
Earth. It involved stripping the hose from a lunar suit and 
rigging the hose to the taped-over CM double canister, 
using the suit's fan to draw carbon dioxide from the cabin 
through the canister and expel it back 
into the LM as pure oxygen.

Emergency scrubbers were built by Swigert and Haise.

double canister and holding one 
end of a suit nozzle while Fred Haise

Underneath the canister is a "mailbox" built of arched 
cardboard, which was covered by a plastic bag. When Lovell 
later saw the rig put together on Earth, he said, 
"It looks just like the one we mode." It saved the 
astronauts from possible death from 
carbon dioxide.
</table>
</center>
<br>

As we approached the Moon, the ground informed us that we
would have to use the LM descent engine a second time; this time
a long 5-minute burn to speed up our return home. The maneuver
was to take place 2 hours after rounding the far side of the
Moon, and I was busy running down the procedures we were to use.
Suddenly, I noticed that Swigert and Haise had their cameras out
and were busy photographing the lunar surface. I looked at them
incredulously and said, "If we don't make this next maneuver
correctly, you won't get your pictures developed!" They said,
"Well, you've been here before and we haven't." Actually, some of
the pictures these tourists took turned out to be very useful.
<br><br>
It was about this time that I said, "Boys, take a good look
at the Moon. It's going to be a long time before anybody gets up
here again." Later on I was accused of sabotaging Apollo; poor
Dr. Paine had to explain that I didn't really mean it, and the
space program would go on. The Senate Space Committee asked me
about it a week after we got back. Actually, I didn't mean that
remark to be public. (I later learned that, unknown to us, we had
had a hot mike for about 45 minutes.) Nonetheless, it was 9
months before Apollo 14 was launched.
<br><br>
We had many crises on Apollo 13, but the biggest heart-
stopper has hardly been noticed, partly because the transcription
released to the press was garbled, and partly because there
wasn't much point in talking about a crisis that had been averted
earlier. It occurred prior to the second maneuver I mentioned
earlier; we called it P.C. + 2 (pericynthian 2 hours).
<br><br>
We had transferred the CM platform alignment to the LM. but
we had to make sure that this alignment was accurate before we
made the long P.C. + 2 burn. Ordinarily it is simple to look
through the sextant device, called the Alignment Optical
Telescope, find a suitable navigation star, and with the help of
our computer verify the guidance platform's alignment. But
traveling with us was a swarm of debris from the ruptured service
module. The sunlight glinting on these bits of junk- I called
them false stars- made it impossible to sight a real star.

<br><br>

Without a course correction, the returning spacecraft 
would have missed the Earth completely. Inertial references 
were stored in the guidance platform, but sightings 
an the Sun gave the astronauts confidence that 
the crucial burn would be properly oriented.

Food was refrigerator-cold.

<br>

So what to do? If we couldn't verify the accuracy of the
alignment, we didn't have a way to make an accurate burn, or to
align the CM platform for reentry. In other words, the ground
would have no accurate way to tell us the correct attitude to
make the proper maneuvers to return home.
<br><br>
A genius in Mission Control came up with the idea of using
the Sun to check the accuracy of our alignment. No amount of
debris could blot out that star! Its large diameter could result
in considerable error, but nobody had a better plan.
<br><br>
I rotated the spacecraft to the attitude Houston had
requested. If our alignment was accurate, the Sun would be
centered in the sextant.

When I looked through the AOT, the Sun just had to be there.
It really had to be. And it was. At 73:46 hours the air-to-ground
transcript sounds like a song from "My Fair Lady":
<br><br>
Lovell: O.K. We got it. I think we got it. What diameter was
it?
<br><br>
Haise: Yes. It's coming back in. Just a second.
<br><br>
Lovell: Yes, yaw's coming back in. Just about it.
<br><br>
Haise: Yaw is in....
<br><br>
Lovell: What have you got?
<br><br>
Haise: Upper right corner of the Sun....
<br><br>
Lovell: We've got it!
<br><br>
If we raised our voices, I submit it was justified.
<br><br>
I'm told the cheer of the year went up in Mission Control.
Flight Director Gerald Griffin, a man not easily shaken, recalls:
"Some years later I went back to the log and looked up that
mission. My writing was almost illegible I was so damned nervous.
And I remember the exhilaration running through me: My God,
that's kinds the last hurdle -- if we can do that, I know we can
make it. It was funny, because only the people involved knew how
important it was to have that platform properly aligned." Yet
Gerry Griffin barely mentioned the alignment in his change-of-
shift briefing -- "That check turned out real well" is all he said
an hour after his penmanship failed him Neither did we, as crew
members, refer to it as a crisis in our press conference nor in
later articles.
<br><br>
The alignment with the Sun proved to be less than a half a
degree off. Hallelujah Now we knew we could do the 5-minute P.C.
+ 2 burn with assurance, and that would cut the total time of our
voyage to about 142 hours. We weren't exactly home free: we had a
dead service module, a command module with no power, and a lunar
module that was a wonderful vehicle to travel home in, but
unfortunately didn't have a heat shield required to enter the
Earth's atmosphere. But all we needed now was a continuation of
the expertise we seemed blessed with, plus a little luck.

 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
 <h3>CHAPTER 13.5</h3>
 <hr><br>
</center>

<h3>TIRED, HUNGRY, WET, COLD, DEHYDRATED</h3>

The trip was marked by discomfort beyond the lack of food
and water. Sleep was almost impossible because of the cold. When
we turned off the electrical systems, we lost our source of heat,
and the Sun streaming in the windows didn't much help. We were as
cold as frogs in a frozen pool, especially Jack Swigert, who got
his feet wet and didn't have lunar overshoes. It wasn't simply
that the temperature dropped to 38 F: the sight of perspiring
walls and wet windows made it seem even colder. We considered
putting on our spacesuits, but they would have been bulky and too
sweaty. Our teflon-coated inflight coveralls were cold to the
touch, and how we longed for some good old thermal underwear.

A beautiful sight! Two flight controllers at the 
Mission Control Center watch the parachute deployment as Odyssey 
floats down toward a gentle landing in the Pacific near 
American Samoa. Splashdown, at 1:07 p.m. EST, brought 
down the curtain on the most harried and critical 
emergency of the entire manned space program.

The charred command module splashed down less 
than four miles from the recovery ship USS Iwo Jima. Three 
very tired, hungry, cold, dehydrated astronauts 
await a ride up into the recovery helicopter.  
They were aboard the recovery ship less than 
one hour after touching down in the Pacific.

<br>

The ground, anxious not to disturb our homeward trajectory,
told us not to dump any waste material overboard. What to do with
urine taxed our ingenuity. There were three bags in the command
module; we found six little ones in the LM, then we connected a
PLSS condensate tank to a long hoses and finally we used two
large bags designed to drain remaining water out of the PLSS's
after the first lunar EVA. I'm glad we got home when we did,
because we were just about out of ideas for stowage.
<br><br>
A most remarkable achievement of Mission Control was quickly
developing procedures for powering up the CM after its long cold
sleep. They wrote the documents for this innovation in three
days, instead of the usual three months. We found the CM a cold,
clammy tin can when we started to power up. The walls, ceiling,
floor, wire harnesses, and panels were all covered with droplets
of water. We suspected conditions were the same behind the
panels. The chances of short circuits caused us apprehension, to
say the least. But thanks to the safeguards built into the
command module after the disastrous fire in January 1967, no
arcing took place. The droplets furnished one sensation as we
decelerated in the atmosphere: it rained inside the CM.
<br><br>
Four hours before landing, we shed the service module;
Mission Control had insisted on retaining it until then because
everyone feared what the cold of space might do to the
unsheltered CM heat shield. I'm glad we weren't able to see the
SM earlier. With one whole panel missing, and wreckage hanging
out, it was a sorry mess as it drifted away.

Three hours later we parted with faithful Aquarius, rather
rudely, because we blasted it loose with pressure in the tunnel
in order to make sure it completely cleared. Then we splashed
down gently in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa, a beautiful landing
in a blue-ink ocean on a lovely, lovely planet.
<br><br>
Nobody believes me, but during this six-day odyssey we had
no idea what an impression Apollo 13 made on the people of Earth.
We never dreamed a billion people were following us on television
and radio, and reading about us in banner headlines of every
newspaper published. We still missed the point on board the
carrier Iwo Jima, which picked us up, because the sailors had
been as remote from the media as we were. Only when we reached
Honolulu did we comprehend our impact: there we found President
Nixon and Dr. Paine to meet us, along with my wife Marilyn,
Fred's wife Mary (who being pregnant, also had a doctor along
just in case), and bachelor Jack's parents, in lieu of his usual
airline stewardesses.

In case you are wondering about the cause of it all, I refer
you to the report of the Apollo 13 Review Board, issued after an
intensive investigation. In 1965 the CM had undergone many
improvements, which included raising the permissible voltage to
the heaters in the oxygen tanks from 28 to 65 volts DC.
Unfortunately, the thermostatic switches on these heaters weren't
modified to suit the change. During one final test on the launch
pad, the heaters were on for a long period of time. "This
subjected the wiring in the vicinity of the heaters to very high
temperatures (1000 F), which have been subsequently shown to
severely degrade teflon insulation . . . the thermostatic
switches started to open while powered by 65 volts DC and were
probably welded shut." Furthermore, other warning signs during
testing went unheeded and the tank, damaged from 8 hours
overheating, was a potential bomb the next time it was filled
with oxygen. That bomb exploded on April 13, 1970 - 200,000 miles
from Earth.

A collective sigh of relief rose from the millions 
following the drama of Apollo 13 when the Odyssey splashed 
down. The CM-shaped bandage on this eagle cleverly depicts 
the flight home. "Only in a formal sense will Apollo 
13 go into history as a failure", editorialized 
The New York Times.

<br>

First I want to share a new view of Earth? using the
corrected vision of space. Like our childhood home, we really see
the Earth only as we prepare to leave it. There are the basically
familiar views from the now well-traveled orbits: banded sunrises
and sunsets changing in seconds from black to purple to red to
yellow to searing daylight and then back; tinted oceans and
continents with structural patterns wrought by aging during four
and a half billion years; shadowed clouds and snows ever-varying
in their mysteries and beauty; and the warm fields of lights and
homes, now seen without the boundaries in our minds.
<br><br>
Again like the childhood home that we now only visit-
changing in time but unchanged in the mind- we see the full Earth
revolve beneath us. All the tracks of man's earlier greatness and
folly are displayed in the window: the Roman world, the
explorers' paths around the continents, the trails across older
frontiers, the great migrations of peoples. The strange
perspective is that of the entire Earth filling only one window,
and gradually not even doing that. No longer is it the Earth of
our past, but only a delicate blue globe in space. With something
of the sadness felt as loved ones age, we sec the full Earth
change to half and then to a crescent and then to a faint moonlit
hole in space. The line of night crosses water, land? and cloud,
sending its armies of shadows ahead. We see that night, like time
itself, masks but does not destroy beauty.
<br><br>
In sunlight, the sparkling sea shows its ever-changing
character in the Sun's reflection, in varying hues of blue and
green around the turquoise island beads, and in its icy
competition with polar lands. The arcing, changing sails of
clouds, following whirling, streaking pathways of wind, mark the
passage of the airy lifeblood of the planet.

<br><br>

Comparable to the Grand Canyon in scale and grandeur,
the Valley of Taurus-Littrow extends some 20 miles through
the ring of massifs surrounding the plains of the Serenitatis
basin. In this westward-looking view from Apollo 17 LM Challenger,
CSM America is the small central speck below and ahead, approaching
the neck of the valley between the 1 1/2 mile high massifs.
</table>
</center>
<br>

The revolving equatorial view concentrates our attention.
There is the vast unbroken expanse of the Indian Ocean, south of
the even more vast green and tan continent of Asia. In another
complete view there are all of the blending masses of greens,
reds, and yellows of Africa from the Mediterranean to the Cape of
Good Hope, from Cap Vert to the Red Sea. Then we see across the
great Atlantic from matching coast to matching coast. Scanning
all of South America with one glance, we seemingly cease to move
as the planet turns beneath us. And then there is the South
Pacific. At one point only the brilliant ranges and plains of
Antarctica remind a viewer that land still exists. The red
continent of Australia finally conquers the illusion that the
Earth is ocean alone, becoming the Earth's natural desert beacon.
<br><br>
When at last we are held to our own cyclic wandering about
the Moon, we see Earthrise, that first and lasting symbol of a
generation's spirit, imagination, and daring. That lonesome,
marbled bit of blue with ancient seas and continental rafts is
our planet, our home as men travel the solar system. The
challenge for all of us is to guard and protect that home,
together, as people of Earth.

 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
 <h3>CHAPTER 14.2</h3>
 <hr><br>
</center>

<h3>A NEW VIEW OF THE MOON</h3>

What will historians write many years from now about the
Apollo expeditions to the Moon? Perhaps they will note that it
was a technological leap not undertaken under the threat of war;
competition, yes, but not war. Surely they will say that Apollo
marked man's evolution into the solar system, an evolution no
longer marked by the slow rates of biological change, but from
then paced only by his intellect and collective will. Finally, I
believe that they will record that it was then that men first
acquired an understanding of a second planet.
<br><br>
What then is the nature of this understanding, and how did
the visits of Apollo 15, 16, and 17 to Hadley-Apennines,
Descartes, and Taurus-Littrow relate to it?
<br><br>
The origins of the Moon and the Earth remain obscure,
although the boundaries of possibility are now much more limited.
The details of the silicate chemistry of the rocks of the Moon
and Earth now make us reasonably confident that these familiar
bodies were formed about 4.6 billion years ago in about the same
part of the youthful solar system. However, the two bodies
evolved separately.

Apollos 15, 16, and 17, were chosen primarily to
expand knowledge of light-colored highland areas,
and the ancient crust of the Moon that is 4.5 billion 
years old. Choices of Hadley-Appennines for 15,
Descartes for 16, and Taurus-Littrow for 17 were 
compromises between this goal and constraints imposed 
by availability of high-quality imagery for planning,
ideal distribution of geophysical instruments, landing
safety considerations, and propulsive energy of the
Apollo/Saturn system. Note that later missions were not
targeted so closely to the equator. Full-Moon photo here,

As many scientists now view the results of our Apollo
studies, the Moon, once formed, evolved through six major phases.
Of great future importance is the strong possibility that the
first five of these phases also occurred on Earth, although other
processes have obscured their effects. Thus, the Moon appears to
be an ever more open window into our past.
<br><br>
The known phases of lunar evolution are as follows:
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>The existence of a melted shell from about 4.6 to 4.4
billion years ago.
<br><br>
<li>Bombardment to form the cratered highlands from about 4.4
to 4.1 billion years ago.
<br><br>
<li>The creation of the large basins from about 4.1 to 3.9
billion years ago.
<br><br>
<li>A brief period of formation of light-colored plains about
3.9 billion years ago.
<br><br>
<li>The eruption of the basaltic maria from about 3.8 to
about 3.1 billion years ago.
<br><br>
<li>The gradual transition to a quiet crust from about 3.0
billion years ago until the present.
</ol>
<br>

The detail by which we understand these six phases of lunar
evolution is quite great. It derives from analysis of returned
samples and observations of their geologic setting on the Moon,
from the interpretation of geophysical and geochemical data from
stations that still operate on the Moon or that previously
operated in lunar orbit, and from our experience on Earth.

<br>

During the melted shell phase from about 4.6 to 4.4 billion
years ago, at least the outer 200 miles of the Moon was molten or
partially molten. As this shell cooled, the formation and
settling of crystals of differing composition resulted in the
creation of major chemical differences between various layers
tens to hundreds of miles thick. A crust, mantle, and core
apparently were formed at this time. The crust consisted of
light-colored minerals rich in calcium and aluminum (largely the
mineral plagioclase); the mantle contained dark minerals rich in
magnesium and iron (largely the minerals pyroxene and olivine);
and the core probably was composed of dense, molten material rich
in iron and sulfur.

<h3>INCONCEIVABLE VIOLENCE</h3>

The cratered highland phase that followed was extremely,
almost inconceivably violent. The debris left over from the
creation of the planets bombarded the light-colored crust. These
highland surfaces have survived as the bright portions of the
full Moon we see today. They were pulverized, remelted,
reaggregated, and, finally, saturated with craters at least 30 to
60 miles in diameter. The sheer violence of those times is
difficult to comprehend.
<br><br>
The large basin phase was the time when very large basins
were formed. This appears to have been the result of a distinctly
more massive scale of bombardment than that which preceded their
formation. These large basins dominate the surface character of
the front side of the Moon and are responsible for the major
chemical differences we have measured between various large
surface regions.

</center>
<br>

The light-colored plains phase that followed was a brief,
still controversial period in which most old basins appear to
have been partially filled with debris largely derived from the
surrounding light-colored crust. The events that created these
plains are poorly understood partly because several different
processes related to both meteor impact and internal volcanism
may have produced similar plains.
<br><br>
The basaltic maria phase was the main period during which
the accumulation of heat from radioactive elements within the
Moon produced melting and volcanic eruptions. Those eruptions
filled all of the large basins with thick masses of dark-colored
basalt called the maria. (These sea-like regions are the dark
portions of the full Moon.) The lunar basalts are very different
from basalts on Earth; they contain much less sodium, carbon, and
water and commonly have much more titanium. iron, and heavy
elements. At least the upper parts of the maria are ancient lava
flows up to 300 feet thick. Many flows differ significantly from
each other in chemical and mineral characteristics, differences
that vary with both the age and the region.

<br>

The quiet crust phase from about 3.0 billion years ago to
the present was largely just that- quiet. Compared to the past,
very little happened except for the formation of scattered, very
bright craters like Tycho and Copernicus, the creation of
regional fault systems like the Hyginus Rille, and the appearance
of mysterious light-colored swirls like Reiner Gamma. Eruptions
of basaltic maria also seem to have continued along a ridge and
volcanic system that stretches for 1200 miles along the north-
south axis of Mare Procellarum. Some of the events may be
indications of continuing internal activity and stress beneath a
now strong crust, such as the slow, solid convection of the lunar
mantle.
<br><br>
For the most part, the surface of the Moon appears to have
completed recording its history about three billion years ago. It
has been largely unchanged except for the continued eroding rain
of small meteors and now by the first primitive probings of men.
<br><br>
The Moon is as chemically and structurally differentiated as
the Earth, lacking only the continued refinements of internal
melting, solid convection, surficial weathering, and recycling of
the crust. It moves through space as an ancient text, related to
the history of the Earth only through the interpretations of our
minds. It also exists as an archive of our Sun, possibly
preserving in its soils much information of importance to man's
future.
<br><br>
If we are to continue to read the text, we must continue to
go there and beyond.

 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
 <h3>CHAPTER 14.4</h3>
 <hr><br>
</center>

<h3>THE MISSIONS OF UNDERSTANDING</h3>

The last three Apollo journeys were great missions of
understanding during which our interpretation of the evolution of
the Moon evolved. In July 1971 the first of these missions,
Apollo 15, visited Hadley Rille at the foot of the Apennine
Mountains. Apollo 15 gave lunar exploration a new scale in
duration and complexity. Col. David R. Scott, Col. James B.
Irwin, and Lt. Col. Alfred M. Worden looked at the whole planet
for 13 days through the eyes of precision cameras and electronics
as well as the eyes of men. Scott and Irwin spent nearly 67 hours
on the Moon's surface, and were the first to use a wheeled
surface vehicle, the Rover, to inspect a wide variety of
geological features. Finally, before returning to Earth, they
placed a small satellite in lunar orbit that greatly expanded our
knowledge of the distribution and geological correlation of
gravitational and magnetic variations within the Moon's crust.

Sampling scoop in hand, I go questing at Station 5 by Camelot
Crater. At this point I had already collected a load of samples,
and will shortly curve back to the Rover, off-camera at left, to
unload. This was our second EVA, covering some 11 miles.
</table>
</center>
<br>

The varied samples and observations from the vicinity of
Hadley Rille and the mountain ring of Imbrium called the Apennine's
pushed knowledge of lunar processes back past the four-billion-
year barrier we had seemed to see on previous missions. We also
discovered that lunar history behind this barrier was partially
masked by multiple cycles of impact melting and fragmentation.
Nevertheless, the rock fragments we sampled gave vague glimpses
into the first half-billion years of lunar evolution and into
some details of the nature of the melted shell. Part of this view
into the past was provided by the well-known "Genesis Rock" of
anorthosite (a plagioclase-rich rock). In addition, we expanded
our understanding of the complex volcanic processes that created
the present surfaces of the maria. These processes were now seen
to have included not only the internal separation of minerals
within lava flows but possible processes of volcanic erosion and
fracturing that could have created the rilles.

Our three traverses on Apollo 17 came very close to 
those we had preplanned, differing only because of
unexpected findings. The fist run was a mile and a quarter to
Steno Crater and back, in the 4 o'clock position above. The second
was the longest, at 5 o'clock. At station 4 near Shorty Crater
we found the orange soil (see <a href="ch-14-4.html#osoil">here</a>).
The third run, at 12 to 1 o'clock, was more than six miles. The
great fractured boulder shown <a href="ch-14-6.html#boulder">here</a> 
is on the slope near Station 6.
</table>
</center>
<br>

The Apollo 15 astronauts placed instruments on the Moon
which, in conjunction with earlier missions, finally established
a geophysical net of stations. Of particular importance was a net
of seismometers by which we began to decipher the inner structure
of the Moon. Correlations of information from these stations with
other facts enabled us to interpret several major portions of the
interior. The Moon's crustal rocks, rich in the calcium and
aluminum silicate plagioclase, are broken extensively near the
surface but more coherent at depths from 15 to 40 miles. The
crust rests on an upper mantle 125 to 200 miles thick that
contains the magnesium and iron silicates, pyroxene and olivine.
From about 200 or 250 to about 400 miles deep, the lower mantle
is possibly similar to some types of stony meteorites called
chondrites. From about 400 miles to about 700 miles deep, the
chondrite material appears to be locally melted and seismically
active. There are also many reasons now to believe that the Moon
has an iron-rich core from about 700 miles deep to its center at
1080 miles that produced a global magnetic field until only
recent times.

Sampling by scoop was the main way we obtained the large numbers
of small samples that provide good statistical information about
the composition of the surface. That instrument to the left of
Apollo 15's Jim Irwin is a gnomon. It provides a vertical-seeking
rod of known length, a color chart, and a shadow - all useful
for calibrating pictures.

Sampling tongs and coring tubes gave us other means of 
collecting special samples. The spring-loaded tongs below let us
pick up small rocks and fragments without getting down on our
knees or otherwise reaching way down with clumsy gloves. The
core tubes were hammered down into the soil and then drawn back
out and capped. They gave us a way to collect sections of soil that
preserved the relative relationships undisturbed.
</table>
</center>
<br>

The geophysical station at Hadley-Apennines also told us
that the flow of heat from the Moon was possibly two times that
expected for a body having approximately the same radioisotopic
composition as the Earth's mantle. If true, this tended to
confirm earlier suggestions that much of the radioisotopic
material in the Moon was concentrated in its crust. Otherwise,
the interior of the Moon would be more fluid and show greater
activity than we sense with the seismometers.

Finding orange soil near Station 4 on Apollo 17 at the 
time when oxygen was running low kept us on the jump. We dug a trench
8 inches deep and 35 inches long, took samples of the orange soil and
nearby gray soil, drove a core tube into the deposit, sampled 
surrounding rocks, described and photographed the crater site in
detail, and packed the samples - all in 35 minutes. The effort gave
scientists a most unusual sample: very small beads of orange volcanic
glass, formed in a great eruption of fire fountains over 
3.5 billion years ago.

<br>

We began with Apollo 15 to be able to correlate our landing
areas around the whole Moon by virtue of very-high-quality
photographs and geochemical x-ray and gamma-ray mapping from
orbit. The x-ray remote sensing investigations disclosed the
provincial nature of lunar chemistry, particularly by
highlighting differences in aluminum-to-silicon and magnesium-to-
silicon ratios within the maria and the highlands. By outlining
variations in the distribution of uranium, thorium, and
potassium, the gamma-ray information suggested that large basin-
forming events were capable of creating geochemical provinces by
the ejection of material from depths of six or more miles.
<br><br>
Possibly of equal importance with all these findings by
Apollo 15 was the discovery - shared through television by
millions of people - that there existed beauty and majesty in
views of nature that had previously been outside human
experience.
<br><br>
The mission of Apollo 16 to Descartes in April 1972 revealed
that we were not yet ready to understand the earliest chapters of
lunar history exposed in the southern highlands. In the samples
that Capt. John W. Young, Comdr. Thomas K. Mattingly. and Col.
Charles M. Duke, Jr., obtained in the Descartes area, the major
central events of that history seemed to be compressed in time
far more than we had guessed. There are indications that the
formation of the youngest major lunar basins, the eruption of
light-colored plains materials, and the earliest extrusions of
mare basalts required only about 100 million years of time around
3.9 billion years ago.

Ancient beads of orange volcanic glass in
the photomicrograph above have revealed secrets
of the Moon's deep interior. Produced most likely
by the partial melting of the lunar mantle,
and discovered by Apollo 17, these beads are
unusualy rich in such volatile elements as lead,
zinc, tellurium, and sulfur. This indicates not
only volcanic origin but also derivation from
rocks possibly as deep as 200 miles in the
Moon. Similar glass beads, green in color, 
were discovered by Apollo 15.
</table>
</center>
<br>

The extreme complexity of the problem of interpreting the
lunar highland rocks and processes became evident even as the
Apollo 16 mission progressed. Rather than discovering materials
of clearly volcanic origin as many expected, the men found
samples that suggested an interlocking, sequence of igneous and
impact processes. A new chemical rock group known as "very high
aluminum basalts" could be defined, although its ancestry
relative to other lunar materials was obscured by later events
that gave the cratered highlands their present form. The results
of Apollo 16 have within them an integrated look at almost all
previously and subsequently identified highland rock types. With
this complexity comes a unique, as yet unexploited, opportunity
to understand the formation and modification of the Moon's early
crust and potentially that of the Earth.
<br><br>
The materials found in the Descartes region were similar to
those sampled slightly earlier by Luna 20 in the Apollonius
region. But there were significant differences in the aluminum
content of debris representative of the two regions. Also there
were differences in the abundance of fragments of distinctive
crystalline rocks known as the anorthosite-norite-troctolite
suite. After Apollo 15, this suite of rocks had been recognized
as possibly being a much reworked leftover of at least portions
of the ancient lunar crust. Luna 20 and Apollo 16 confirmed its
great importance to the understanding of the ancient melted
shell.

<h3>A MAJOR THERMAL EVENT?</h3>

The last crystallization age of some of the Apollo 16 rocks
appeared to be about 3.9 billion years, and continued to indicate
that this age is a major turning point in lunar history. This
general age for the cooling of highland-like materials also was
found to hold for the ejecta blanket of the Imbrium Basin at Fra
Mauro, for the rocks of the Apennines, and later for some of the
highland rocks at Taurus-Littrow. This limit suggested (1) a
major thermal event associated with the formation of several
large basins over a relatively short time, or (2) a major thermal
event associated with the formation of the light-colored plains,
or (3) the rapid cessation of the period of major cratering that
continually reworked the highlands until most vestiges of
original ages had disappeared and only the last local impact
event was recorded. As we attempt to explain the absence of very
old rocks on Earth, we should not forget these possibilities for
resetting our own geologic clocks.

Apollo 16 continued the broad-scale geological, geochemical,
and geophysical mapping of the Moon's crust from orbit begun by
Apollo 15. This mapping greatly expanded our knowledge of
geochemical provinces and geophysical variations, and has helped
to lead to many of the generalizations it is now possible to make
about the evolution of the lunar crust.
<br><br>
Apollo 17 carried Capt. Eugene A. Cernan, Capt. Ronald
Evans, and me in December 1972 to the valley of Taurus-Littrow
near the coast of the great frozen basaltic "sea" of Serenitatis.
The unique visual character and beauty of this valley was, I
hope, seen by most people on television as we saw it in person.
The unique scientific character of this valley has helped to
lessen our sadness that Apollo explorations ended with our visit.
It would have been hard to find a better locality in which to
synthesize and expand our ideas about the evolution of the Moon.

Apollo 17 photographed itself in the frame at right from its panoramic

Challenger. The landing point (see inset at left) is revealed by 
a bright spot, produced by the effects of the descent-engine exhaust.  
A reflection from and shadow of the LM are also visible in 
high-quality prints. The panoramic camera has an absolute resolution of 
about 1 meter in best prints.<br>
Detailed analysis of this panoramic photograph indicates that 
the light-colored avalanche, and many of the craters on the valley
floor, are probably the result of the impact of material ejected 
some 50 million years ago from the crater Tycho 1300 miles to the
southwest. Such orbital data have been invaluable in expanding the 
context of our interpretations of samples and data that were returned 
from explorations on the surface.

<br>

At Taurus-Littrow we looked at and sampled the ancient lunar
record ranging back from the extrusion of the oldest known mare
basalts, through the formation of the fragmental rocks of the
Serenitatis mountain ring, and thence back into fragments in
these rocks that may reflect the very origins of the lunar crust.
We also found and are now studying volcanic materials and
debris-forming processes that range forward from the formation of
the earliest mare basalt surface through 3.8 billion years of
modification of that surface.
<br><br>
The pre-mare events in the Taurus-Littrow region that
culminated in the formation of the Serenitatis Basin produced at
least three major and distinctive units of complex fragmental
rocks. The oldest of these rock units contains distinctive
fragments of crystalline magnesium and iron-rich rocks that
appear to be the remains of the crystallization of the melted
shell. This conclusion is supported by a crushed rock of
magnesium olivine with an apparent crystallization age of 4.6
billion years. The old fragmental rock unit containing these
ancient fragments was intruded and locally altered by another
unit which was partially molten at the time of intrusion about
3.9 billion years ago. Such intrusive fragmental rocks are
probably the direct result of the massive impact event that
formed the nearby Serenitatis Basin; however, an internal
volcanic origin cannot yet be ruled out. The third fragmental
rock unit seems to cap the tops of the mountains and it may be
the ejecta from one of the several large old basins within range
of the valley. This unit contains a wide variety of fragments of
the lunar crust, including barium-rich granitic rock.

The valley of Taurus-Littrow and other low areas nearby
appear to be a fortuitous window that exposes some of the oldest,
if not the oldest, mare basalt extrusives on the Moon. They are
about 3.8 billion years old, and are 50 to 100 million years
older than the basalts at Tranquility Base. They also contain
titanium oxide in amounts up to 13 percent by weight.

<h3>BEADS OF ORANGE GLASS</h3>

The modification of the surface of the valley basalt
included the addition of mantles of beads of chemically
distinctive orange glass (the "orange soil") and black
devitrified glass. The beads appear to have been formed by
volcanic processes having their origins in the deep interior of
the Moon. The titanium-, magnesium-, and iron-rich nature of
these silicate glasses surprised us in many ways. Their
approximately 10- to 30-million-year age of exposure to the Sun
is young and was expected for the dark mantling deposits seen in
photographs; but their 3.5- to 3.7-billion-year age of cooling
from a liquid was not expected. The explanation for this
difference is not yet obvious.

have been viewed only in the subdued blue light of Earth. The
promise of these regions and of the far side of the Moon has not
diminished. They seemingly watch the progression of sunrises,

<h3>A NEW WAY OF EXPLORATION</h3>

The great explorations of history were unique, but in some
ways all voyages of exploration are alike. There is a means of
transportation; food, tools, and a way of living; methods of
investigation, mapping, and sampling; and the collaboration of
fellow explorers. What distinguishes one voyage from another is
the place gone to and the discoveries made there. In our time,
the places were on the Moon, and the discoveries have revealed
another planet.
<br><br>
In Apollo, our ships were Saturns and CSMs, the latter more
than just transport and resupply ships, for they were also
orbiting laboratories, bearing spectrometers, lasers, and
precision cameras. Our sketchbooks and notebooks were cameras and
voice recordings. The alert experts of Mission Control were our
guardian angels, in addition to those issued by Providence. The
landed lunar module was our base camp, and the lunar rover was
our steed. On the Apollo 17 mission, the LM Challenger could
support us in its base-camp role for 75 hours, with a contingency
margin of 12 hours more. In one-sixth gravity, its hammocks
provided comfortable sleeping positions, with none of the lumps
of camp cots or pine boughs. The total absence of black flies or
mosquitoes was wonderful; and the rehydrated food was better than
the grub dished up by some camp cooks.
<br><br>
Out on the surface, the backpack could support us for seven
to eight hours, depending on physical exertion. We carried enough
extra oxygen, water, and batteries in Challenger to recharge the
backpack twice, for three major excursions outside. We also had
an emergency supply of oxygen in the backpack that could provide
at least 30 minutes of suit pressure and oxygen at large rates of
flow, in case the suit was holed. Only one aspect of work in the
pressure suit was very difficult and that was the effort of
gripping tools against pressure within the glove. Like squeezing
a tennis ball repetitively for nine hours, this was very
fatiguing to forearm muscles; we also separated our fingernails
from the quick as the nails scraped against the glove fingers.
The forearm fatigue disappeared after each night's sleep; sore
fingernails did not disappear until days after we left the Moon.

<h3>TOURING THE MOON</h3>

Encumbered by a spacesuit, an astronaut on foot could 
not venture very far from the LM; carrying tools and 
samples made his forays more difficult.  On the last 
three lunar missions a lightweight electric car greatly increased 
the productivity of the scientific traverses.  Mission 
rules restricted us from going more than 6 miles from the 
LM - the distance we could walk back in a pinch - but even 
so the area that could be investigated was ten times 
greater than before.  The Rover's mobility was quite high; 
it could climb and descend slopes above 25.  Crossing a 
steep slope was uneasy for the man on the downhill side, 
but there were no rollovers. On the level we averaged 
close to our top speed of 7 mph.  Once, going down the 
Lee-Lincoln scarp, we set an informal lunar speed record 
for four-wheeled vehicles of 11 mph.

out from its storage bay. Then the rear part of the chassis 
unfolds and locks, and the rear wheels unfold. In the third 
stage the front chassis and wheels snap out.
Finally, the astronaut lowers it to the surface, and 
unfolds the seats and footrests. Torsion-bar springs and latches 
mode assembly semiautomatic. Power for the Rover came 
from two 36-volt silver-zinc batteries driving an 
independent 1/4-hp motor in each wheel. A navigation 
system kept track of the bearing and range to the LM.

<h2>The Legacy of Apollo</h2>

Our conceptions are altered when the point of view is shifted.  
When the Apollo 15 astronauts took this picture from lunar orbit, 
they saw the Earth as a thin crescent. At the same time, we on 
Earth were seeing a nearly full Moon.
</table>
</center>
<br>

Because we live on it, the Earth is the center of things for
us. Around Earth all other celestial bodies circle endlessly, or
so it seemed to our forebears. For countless generations men who
thought about such matters regarded the Earth as the center of
the universe. So satisfying was this view, so entrenched in
doctrine and dogma did it become, that when Copernicus and Kepler
challenged the idea, they stirred up a hornet's nest. The concept
of the Sun as the central stillness in the solar system around
which Earth and all other planets revolve was considered too
unsettling to be tolerated, and edict and persecution sought to
suppress these dangerous new ideas. But in vain, for the
Copernican revolution in human thought continues to this very
day. In countless ways it colors the picture men draw of
themselves and of man's place in the universe.
<br><br>
Apollo's greatest impact was to impress dramatically upon
men's minds, more clearly than ever before, the significance of
the Copernican view. The spectacle of a spacecraft leaving Earth
with the incredible speed of almost 6 miles per second- thirteen
times faster than a rifle bullet- traveling through space like a
miniature planet, bearing men for the first time to another
world, focused the attention of hundreds of millions of people.
We saw Earth as only one of nine planets in the solar system,
insignificant, except to us, among the unreachable stars in the
vast expanse of the heavens. In cosmic perspective Earth is but a
tiny object in a remote corner of space, companion to a modest
star, one of a hundred billion stars making up one of billions of
galaxies scattered over unimaginable distances to beyond the
farthest reaches to which we have been able to peer with the most
powerful telescopes.
<br><br>
But while helping to convey Earth's insignificance in the
cosmic scale, Apollo dramatically displayed Earth's uniqueness
and overwhelming significance on the human scale. Standing in
imagination on the rocky rubble of a lunar plain, looking through
an astronaut's eye and camera out over the vast arid wasteland of
our inhospitable satellite, we saw above the horizon the
beautiful, blue, fragile Earth. It awakened a heightened
appreciation of and sense of responsibility toward our home in
space. In the entire solar system, 6 billion miles across, only
Earth so far as we now know nourishes the vast abundance of life
that we so casually accept. Only by understanding thoroughly our
planet and our place on it can we hope to learn how to use its
resources wisely, to preserve for future generations our island
in space in its pristine vigor and beauty. And that is where the
true significance of Apollo lunar science comes in.
<br><br>
To understand fully our own planet, it is essential that we
study many planets, Photography and Spacecraft making comparisons
among them. An inevitable myopia interferes when we try to learn
about planets from the study of only one. The Moon is a planet in
its own right, by reason of its substantial size and mass, and
what we learn of lunar science also advances Earth science.
<br><br>
As our nearest neighbor in space, the Moon has long been an
object of wonder and study. Through the telescope the astronomer
has seen myriads of craters on its surface clear evidence of lava
flows, and even some suggestion of current volcanic activity. The
Moon is decidedly out of round. The sharpness of telescopic
images, and the suddenness with which stars disappear behind the
Moon and later reappear show clearly that the Moon has virtually
no atmosphere. No mountain systems like the Rockies or the
Himalayas could be seen. Without atmospheric erosion and
mountain-building activity, we supposed that the Moon would
preserve on its face the record of solar system history to the
very earliest days. But viewing the Moon from 239,000 miles away
left much room for speculation and disagreement. So when rockets
became available, plans were quickly laid for investigating the
Moon close at hand, eventually by man himself.

 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
 <h3>CHAPTER 15.2</h3>

</center>

<h3>IMPLANTING SENSORS ON THE MOON</h3>

Serious space probe studies of the Moon began with the
Soviet Zond and Luna, and with the U.S. Ranger, Surveyor, and
Lunar Orbiter. Armed with the information obtained by unmanned
probes, the United States carried out the Apollo manned missions,
implanting nuclear-powered geophysical laboratories at several
landing sites, including seismometers, magnetometers, plasma and
pressure gauges, heat flow instruments, and laser corner
reflectors. These laboratories continue to operate long after the
astronauts have returned to Earth. On two missions, the lunar
surface laboratories were supplemented by satellites left in
orbit to support geodetic studies. Detailed studies of lunar
surface composition by X-ray fluorescence and radioactivity
measurements were made from the Apollo spacecraft itself. Most
importantly. the astronauts brought back from their six landing
missions hundreds of pounds of lunar rocks and soil, which,
together with the small amount returned by Soviet unmanned sample
missions, have since been the subject of analysis and study by
scientists around the world.
<br><br>
How old is the Moon? This was the first major question.
Although a few thought the Moon would prove to be considerably
younger than Earth. most felt it would turn out to be of the same
vintage as our own planet. From radioactive dating of the lunar
rocks and soil it is now established that the Moon formed about
4.6 billion years ago. The Moon is, indeed, very old, as old as
Earth, and is telling us much about the earliest years of our
planet and of the solar system. But to our great surprise the
lunar rocks show that the Moon's surface is no longer in its
original condition, having undergone considerable change in the
first 1.5 billion years. A few of the highland rocks in the
Apollo samples are older than 4 billion years - at least one is
4.6 billion years old, the probable time of formation and initial
melting of the Moon - but most of them have been shocked and
remelted by meteoroid impacts 4 billion years ago. Most of the
mare lava flows are from 3 to slightly less than 4 billion years
old. indicating that substantial melting and flow occurred on the
Moon long after its formation. Gravitational energy released
during the aggregation of the Moon, heat generated by radioactive
elements in the lunar material, and thermal effects of the huge
impacts that sculptured the lunar surface all undoubtedly
contributed to the early melting of the outer layers.
<br><br>
What is the physical condition of the lunar surface? The
question generated countless heated debates before the lunar
landings. It was clear from the visible meteorite cratering that
the surface must be thoroughly chopped up. How fine would the
material be? Would it be loosely or densely packed? Could it hold
a spacecraft landed upon it? How thick would the layer of rubble
be? Some spoke of deep deposits of finely powdered dust into
which a spacecraft would sink out of sight. Now we know that the
Moon's surface is everywhere covered with many feet of fragmented
material, or regolith. A sizable fraction of the soil is very
fine dust, but the material is sufficiently cohesive and well
packed that it easily supported the Apollo spacecraft, the
astronauts, and their lunar rover.
<br><br>
Of what is the Moon made? This was a question about which
one could only speculate from afar. It could be essentially
meteoritic material. It might be like the Earth's crust. Or it
might be something entirely different. Any proposition put forth,
however, had to satisfy the constraint that the Moon's density is
only 3.36 , considerably lighter than Earth's average density of
5.5. One of the major questions was: Is there any water there?
Water would be the most important constituent that one might hope
to find on the Moon. It would be essential for the support of any
microbial life there. It would be an invaluable resource for
lunar bases that might be established in the remote future. No
one expected to find water exposed on the surface - it would
quickly evaporate in the airless, oven-hot environment of the
lunar day - but many supposed that there might be substantial
subsurface water in the form of ice as a permafrost. Even if free
water were not found, it was fully expected that there would be
water of crystallization in the lunar minerals.
<br><br>
Learning at firsthand about the stuff of which the Moon is
made from the actual lunar material carried back by the Apollo
astronauts has been one of the most exciting scientific
undertakings of our day. More than 700 scientists, including
several hundred from twenty other countries, have spent uncounted
hours analyzing samples, conducting laboratory tests, and
theorizing over the significance of what was being revealed for
the first time. Annually at the Johnson Space Center they have
assembled to share their findings and to try to explain them. No
water was found. Lunar material is very dry. with practically no
water of crystallization. The hydrous minerals so common on Earth
arc exceedingly rare in the lunar rocks and soil. Moreover, lunar
material is depleted in most volatile elements. suggesting a very
hot processing at some time in their history. The rocks in the
lunar maria arc similar to, though significantly different from,
lavas on Earth. Highland samples show a considerable separation
of lunar material into different minerals, showing a
differentiation like that responsible for the wide variety of
rocks and minerals on Earth. Moon material is neither exactly
like the meteorites nor exactly like the Earth's crust, but all
three could have had a common source with a different history.

 <h3>CHAPTER 15.3</h3>

<h3>HOT DEBATES ABOUT VOLCANOES</h3>

What have been the relative roles of impact cratering and
volcanism? For the crater-ridden Moon the obvious first question
is how were the craters formed: by meteorites hitting the surface
at high velocity, or as the remains of once active volcanoes?
Debates on this subject generated about as much heat as the
volcanoes themselves. Many argued for, or gave the appearance of
arguing for, one extreme or the other. More sober debaters
recognized that both cratering and volcanism played a role and
sought to discern their relative importance. It is clear that the
Moon has changed considerably since it was first formed, but most
of that change occurred more than three billion years ago.
Apparently the first 1.5 billion years were a period of violent
evolution, involving the Mare Imbrium event and other cataclysmic
impacts, followed by the vast flooding of the mare plains with a
series of lava flows. In contrast, the last three billion years
have been relatively quiet, with occasional impacts like those
that generated the craters Copernicus and Tycho, but no great
lava events.
<br><br>
The implication of this for Earth is that during its first
billion years Earth also must have been subjected to severe
bombardment, generating huge craters like those still seen on the
Moon, and this may also have been true for other planets as well.
Certainly the Mariner 9 pictures of Mars and Mariner 10 pictures
of Mercury show that both planets experienced substantial
cratering, while terrestrial radars indicate the same for Venus.
The evidence mounts that violent meteorite bombardment was
widespread in the solar system in times past. On Earth, however,
erosion, crumpling of the crust, and subsequent volcanism have
erased most of the evidence of this early catastrophic period.
<br><br>
Is the Moon still active today? Infrequent observations of
sudden localized glows or hazes on the Moon have caused a stir
when they occurred, and gave rise to speculation as to whether
these were due to current volcanic activity, or were merely
trapped gases shaken loose by moonquakes or meteorite impacts.
There was speculation about whether our satellite was a dead
planet or still a live one. Five Apollo seismometers were set up
at different landing sites, and four of them are still working.
At times of lunar perigee, these detect moonquakes of very deep
foci centered at 500 to 620 miles below the lunar crust. The
energy released over a year by these moonquakes, however, is a
billion times less than that released by earthquakes over a
similar period. No evidence of current volcanic activity on the
Moon has been found from either the unmanned or manned space
missions In most places the soil just below the surface appears
to have been relatively undisturbed for millions of years, which
is consistent with the rarity of large-scale meteorite impacts
that Earth experiences today. At the very surface a slow erosion
takes place by micrometeorite impacts and solar-wind particles,
wearing away on the average a few molecular layers a year on
exposed surfaces. Material does move around. Some material falls
and slides down slopes, some may be moved around by electrostatic
forces, and much of what movement occurs is due to splashes from
meteorite impacts. But all in all, the Moon appears to be
extremely quiet now, in comparison with its earliest history or
with Earth today.
<br><br>
Is the interior of the Moon hot or cold? Discussion of this
subject once made the sparks fly. Assuming the Moon contains
radioactive elements, as does Earth, then the heat generated by
their decay should warm up the interior. But would this source
provide enough heat to melt the Moon? Whatever the cause, the
lava flows apparent on the surface of the Moon show that at least
part of the Moon's interior actually was molten at one time. But
on the other side of the picture, the distinctly out-of-round
shape implies a rigidity that a very hot and plastic Moon would
not have. The Apollo measurements have added fuel to this flaming
controversy. Anomalous concentrations of mass called mascons have
been discovered in the great circular mare basins, detected by
the way in which they distort the Moon's gravitational field. In
a hot, plastic Moon, these mascons would have sunk until the
gravity field was restored to equilibrium. The fact that they
persist today indicates a rigid, cool Moon. Yet melting and lava
flooding in the upper layers of the Moon are widespread.
Electrical conductivities inside the Moon, deduced from the
Moon's reaction to the electrical charges and magnetic fields in
the solar wind, indicate that the outer layers, down to 500 to
620 miles in depth, are now well below the melting point. Below
those levels, however, is a region where seismic shear waves are
markedly attenuated, indicating partial melting of the lunar
material there. Moreover while magnetic measurements do not
reveal any dipole magnetic field at present like that of the
Earth, remnant magnetization in rock samples, and substantial
local magnetic fields. suggest that the Moon may well have had a
dipole field in the past. Since it is believed that such a
planetary magnetic dipole field is generated by circulation in a
liquid core, this implies that at one time the core of the Moon
was molten. This would further imply that the Moon was at one
time quite hot throughout, which gets us right back to the
difficulty of explaining how the mascons and the aspherical shape
can continue to exist. There is a real puzzle here that needs
sorting out.
<br><br>
Does the Moon have any atmosphere at all? Before Apollo it
was already clear that the Moon could have very little
atmosphere. It was expected that heavier gases like argon and
krypton would be found clinging close to the surface, but in the
lower gravitational field lighter gases would long since have
escaped. In large measure this has been confirmed. Argon
generated by radioactivity in the lunar crust, and hydrogen,
helium, and neon from the solar wind, account for most of what
little atmosphere there is, and that is over a billion times less
than the Earth's atmosphere.

 <h3>CHAPTER 15.4</h3>

<h3>ANCIENT TRACKS OF RADIATION</h3>

What are the principal effects of the Sun upon the Moon, and
how do they differ from the effects of the Sun on Earth?
Protected by Earth's atmosphere, we are not directly exposed to
the lethal part of the Sun's radiations. But the airless Moon is
starkly exposed. By a neat twist, this situation gives us a way
of checking up on the Sun's activity over the past few million
years. Cosmic rays from the Sun and galaxy leave tracks in the
soil grains and rock surfaces on which they impact; these tracks
can be enhanced by etching, and counted. The track intensities
indicate the intensity of the radiation to which the materials
were exposed. By analyzing the rate at which lunar material is
brought out onto the surface and then later buried again, it is
possible to estimate the times when different layers in the lunar
regolith were exposed, and for how long. Thus sample cores of the
lunar regolith taken by the Apollo astronauts enable us to look
back in time at the radiation environment experienced by the
Moon. No significant changes in galactic cosmic radiation are
seen, but there is a suggestion that there might have been
variation in solar cosmic rays over the last one to ten million
years. This would imply changes in solar activity, which in turn
may have had effects on Earth.
<br><br>
Is there life on the Moon? Some of the bitterest exchanges
took place over this question If there were life, no matter how
primitive, we would want to study it carefully and compare it
with Earth life. This would require very difficult and expensive
sterilization of all materials and equipment landed on the Moon,
so as not to contaminate Moon life with Earth life. Also there
was the question of contamination of Earth by Moon life, possibly
a serious hazard to us on Earth. So difficult, time-consuming,
and expensive quarantine procedures were urged. On the other side
of this argument were those who pointed to the hostile conditions
on the Moon: virtually no atmosphere, probably no water,
temperatures ranging from 150 C during lunar night to more than
120 C at lunar noon, merciless exposure to lethal doses of solar
ultraviolet, X-rays, and charged particles. No life, they argued,
could possibly exist under these conditions. The biologists
countered: water and moderate temperature conditions below ground
might sustain primitive life forms. And so the argument went on
and on, until finally Apollo flew to the Moon with careful
precautions against back contamination of Earth, but with limited
effort to protect the Moon.
<br><br>
It turns out that there is no evidence that indigenous life
exists now or has ever existed on the Moon. A careful search for
carbon was made, since Earth life is carbon based. In the lunar
samples one hundred to two hundred parts per million of carbon
were found; of this no more than a few tens of parts per million
are indigenous to the lunar material, the rest being brought in
by the solar wind. None of the carbon appears to derive from life
processes. As a consequence, after the first few Apollo flights,
even the back-contamination quarantine procedures were dropped.

 <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
 <h3>CHAPTER 15.5</h3>

<h3>THE NAGGING QUESTION OF ORIGIN</h3>

Where did the Moon come from? This is the big puzzler of
them all. There were three major theories. The Moon came from
Earth, possibly wrenched from what is now the Pacific Ocean. Or
the Moon formed in the vicinity of Earth at the same time that
Earth was forming. Or the Moon formed somewhere else in the solar
system, and was later captured by Earth. Most students of the
subject reject the first possibility, because it proves very
difficult to explain all the steps that must have occurred to
bring this about. That leaves various versions of the last two as
principal contenders. Apollo has done little to favor one over
the other. Indeed, some feel that we will never be able to say
for sure. But the question is a nagging one, and scientists will
continue to argue over it.
<br><br>
The deep significance of the Apollo investigations lies in
the fact that these measurements and observations give us a
detailed insight into a planetary body other than Earth, thereby
helping us to understand better our own planet. Before space
probes, lunar and planetary science had for a long time been
inactive, due in part to lack of new data to spark serious
thought. With the vast quantities of lunar data returned by
Apollo and other lunar missions, together with rich new space-
probe data from Mars, Venus, Mercury. and Jupiter, and new
discoveries on Earth such as the slow spreading of ocean floors
and the drifting of continents, a new field of comparative study
of planets has virtually exploded into world science. In this
comparative investigation of the planets, the Moon is an
important link.
<br><br>
Already it is clear that bodies of planetary size will
undergo considerable evolution after their formation. Most of
this evolution takes place early, and it is probably less in the
case of a Moon-sized planet, leaving the planet relatively quiet
for most of its history. A planet the size of Mars, though
substantially smaller than Earth, remains active for much longer
than a Moon-sized body, as the Mariner 9 pictures clearly show.
With its huge volcanoes, its giant canyon several times deeper
than the Grand Canyon and long enough to span the United States,
its variable polar caps, its suggestion of colliding crustal
plates, Mars is clearly still an active planet. Venus, the size
of the Earth, with its very hot surface and extremely dense and
dynamic atmosphere, may well prove to be more active volcanically
and tectonically than Earth. Mercury, intermediate between Mars
and the Moon in size, is heavily cratered and seems to be much
like the lunar highlands.
<br><br>
It will be fascinating when we can complete this perspective
by studying the giant outer planets on the one hand, and the very
small bodies like the comets and asteroids on the other. As
Pioneer 10 and 11 have shown, Jupiter is extremely dynamic. We
may expect the same to prove true of the other giant planets when
we get a chance to see them close at hand. Moreover, the large
planets, consisting, as they do, mainly of the lighter elements
like hydrogen and helium, should provide a revealing insight into
conditions in the solar nebula at the time the planets of the
solar system were condensing out of the nebula. The same should
be true of the comets and asteroids. The asteroids in particular
are probably too small to have undergone any gravitational or
radioactive melting, and therefore should in their interiors be
as they were at the time of their formation, unless they, too,
turn out to be fragments of what were once larger bodies.

<h3>LIFE IN AN OCEAN OF GAS</h3>

Our atmosphere is the breath of life to everything we do. It
is an ocean of gas in which we live as fish live in an ocean of
water. It is an integral part of our planet, and we cannot
understand Earth's history without also understanding its
atmosphere. In seeking to do this, the wide variation from the
airless Moon to the exotic and turbulent atmosphere of Jupiter
provides an invaluable context and perspective. As it happens,
the solar system has several planetary atmospheres between these
extremes.
<br><br>
Earth's atmosphere lies intermediate in surface pressure
between that of Venus and Mars, Venus' atmosphere being about 100
times that of Earth, and Mars' about one one-hundredth. The
composition of the atmospheres of Venus and Mars is predominantly
carbon dioxide, while Earth's today is predominantly nitrogen and
oxygen. On the other hand, the amount of carbon dioxide tied up
in the carbonate of the Earth's crust is comparable to what we
see free in the atmosphere of Venus today. Presumably on Earth
carbon dioxide exhaled from volcanoes, in the presence of the
abundant water, was soon taken up into the crustal rocks. Life on
Earth doubtless accounts for the presence of so much oxygen in
the atmosphere, most of which was probably generated by
photosynthesis. From the Mariner observations of Mercury, it
appears that Mercury is closer to the Moon than to Mars as far as
atmosphere is concerned.
<br><br>
Much patient work remains to bring out the full significance
of Apollo observations. Nevertheless it is already clear that
Apollo has made a great contribution to the development of the
new field of comparative planetary studies, a field that over the
years will provide us priceless insights into our own planet. In
days of deep concern over the Earth's environment and finite
resources, comparative planetology is a new science of
incalculable importance, and Apollo led the way.

The oldest photograph of lunar details on record.  
The original of this picture was a "Crystalotype" print 
made from a daguerreotype taken in March 1851.  As in all 
telescopic views of the half Moon, relief features are visible 
only near the terminator.  The remainder of the image shows 
only the contrast in reflectivity between the maria and the 
highlands.

Space photography over a vast range of scales is providing 
the raw material for many kinds of study.  This view of the 
almost-full lunar disk was taken when Apollo 17 was about 
2000 miles from the Moon on its way home.  More than a third 
of the area covered is never visible from the Earth.  
Mare Smythii, the dark circular area just to the right of 
the center, straddles the 90' east meridian.  The crater 
Tsiolkovsky is near the terminator at the lower right.

This southward-looking oblique view from an orbital altitude 
of 70 miles places lunar features in a new perspective.  
The crater in the center is Aristarchus, the brightest 
large crater an the Moon. It is 25 miles in diameter and 
2 1/4 miles deep. The low Sun angle has brought into bald 
relief the deposits of ejected material, as well as the strange 
sinuous rilles.

At one point on its coasting path toward the Moon, Apollo 17
lined up with the Sun and the Earth, enabling the astronauts to take
this full-disk view. Since it was December, the beginning of summer
in the Southern Hemisphere, the icecap that covers the Antarctic
continent is brightly illuminated. A most striking feature of the
visible land mass of Africa and southeastern Asia is the transition
from the tawny color of the Sahara, Libyan, and Arabian deserts,
through the dark band of grass-covered savannah, to the cloud-strewn
tropical rain forest.

A complex of huge valleys and tributary canyons, now named the 
Valles Marineris, can be traced across 2500 miles of the Martian 
surface. It is comparable in scale to the Red Sea or the east 
African rift valley system and probably originated, like them, 
in the pulling part of great plates of the planetary crust.  
Tectonic activity of this kind marks a planet that is still 
evolving. The tree-like tributary canyons in the picture 
(a 275-mile segment of Valles Marineris) may be the result of 
water erosion, even though the Martian atmosphere now contains 
little water.

<h4>Given exciting views of giant, turbulent Jupiter ...</h4>

Cloud tops high in the atmosphere form the giant planet's 
visible surface.  This photograph, produced from the red and 
blue digital images of Pioneer 11's imaging photopolarimeter, 
shows the characteristic banding parallel to the equator and 
the elongated circles that mark regions of intense vertical 
convective activity.  Most prominent among these is the Great 
Red Spot, a hurricane-like group of thunderstorms that has 
persisted through several centuries of observation.  
Jupiter's weather systems are long-lived because their 
heat comes mainly from the planet's liquid interior.

<h4>Revealed atmospheric circulations on overheated Venus ...</h4>

Clouds in its very dense atmosphere completely hide Venus' solid 
surface. Although the clouds are nearly featureless at visible 
wavelengths, they show a wealth of detail in the near ultraviolet.  
This ultraviolet picture, taken by the Mariner 10 television camera, 
is one of a post-encounter sequence that shows the cloud-bearing 
atmospheric layer in retrograde (right to left) rotation with a 
four-day period.  The swirling currents of that rotation interact 
with convection cells rising from the subsolar point near the left 
edge of the disk.

The surface of Mercury was revealed to science on March 29, 1974, 
when Mariner 10 took over 1600 television frames just before 
and just after flying past the planet's dark side.  
The left and right halves of this picture are mosaics of 
the pre-encounter and post-encounter frames. A second 
encounter, six months later, provided additional coverage.  
Although the crater interiors on this airless planet closely 
resemble those on the Moon, study of the highresolution frames 
shows external differences that may result from Mercury's stronger 
gravity field.

We shall have to wait a few more years for a closer view of 
Saturn and its rings. Pioneer 11 will encounter the planet 
in September 1979.  Saturn is second in size only to Jupiter, 
with an average density less than that of water. Titan, the 
largest of its ten satellites, is the only one in the solar 
system known to have an appreciable atmosphere. Saturn's rings 
are thin layers of separate particles orbiting in its equatorial 
plane. The ring system is probably less than 60 miles thick, 
and its total mass is very small compared to that of Saturn's 
satellites.
