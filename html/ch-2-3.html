  <h4>Apollo Expeditions to the Moon</h4>
  <h3>CHAPTER 2.3</h3>

<h3>THE YEAR OF DECISIONS (JUNE 1961 TO JUNE 1962)</h3>

The twelve months following the decision to go to the Moon saw the complete
plan unfold. New Centers were created, roles and missions were assigned, and the
basic designs for the launch vehicle and spacecraft were agreed upon. In addition, a
vital new program, called Gemini, was instituted to explore rendezvous, docking, and
the many other factors that were vital before Apollo could set out.

Tiny one-man spacecraft -then called capsules-
orbited the Earth in the Mercury program. 
They were checked out in a hangar at
Cape Canaveral before being hoisted up and
mated with a launch vehicle. Heat-resistant
shingles covered the afterbody.</table>

<br><br>
At the onset of the program, there were two government groups eager to participate. 
There was the Marshall Space Flight Center under Dr. Wernher von Braun,
which was a mature center having more than 5000 people, and there was the small
but expert Space Task Group of only a few hundred people, a group already severely
loaded with the Mercury project.  Mr. Webb, the Administrator, Dr. Dryden, the Deputy 
Administrator, and Dr. Seamans, the Associate Administrator, were the top management 
of the agency, and they brought onboard a young man named Brainerd
Holmes to head the manned spaceflight effort in Washington. This group lost little time
in deciding roles and missions for the lunar program. A new launch center was created
in Florida, and Dr. Kurt Debus, formerly of Marshall, was named its head. The Marshall 
Center got the job of developing the huge Moon rockets, although the size of the
rocket and the mode for going to the Moon had not yet been decided. The decision was
made to expand the Space Task Group into a full NASA Center and assign it the job
of developing the spacecraft and of creating a complex of technical facilities for 
spacecraft research and development, astronaut training, and flight operations. I became
head of this new NASA Center in Houston. The Center facilities were authorized by
Congress, but they did not yet exist. And so during the first year of Apollo the Space
Task Group became the Manned Spacecraft Center and moved from Virginia to Texas.
We occupied some 50-odd rented buildings while the new Center was being designed
and built. It was a period of growth, organization, and growing pains. We were establishing 
new contractor relations, moving families and acquiring new homes, as well as
conducting the orbital flights of Project Mcrcury.

Boiler plate models (below) of escape tower
and spacecraft were tested with Little Joe
boosters at Wallops Station. Little Joe could
briefly deliver up to 250,000 pounds of thrust
from eight solid-fuel rockets. These launches
were in 1959 and 1960.

Many of the key ideas and designs for going to the Moon were created during this
period of upheaval, turmoil, and the stress of major flight activities. Even before the
President's decision to land on the Moon, we had been working on designs and guidelines 
for a manned circumlunar mission. This was done in a series of bull sessions on
how we would design the spaceship for this purpose if the opportunity occurred. Our
key people would get together evenings, weekends, or whenever we could to discuss
such questions as crew size and other fundamental design factors. We believed that we
would need three men on the trip to do all the work required, even before the complexity 
of the landing was added. We believed that man would be able to stand a zero-gravity 
environment for the time required to go to the Moon and return. We had decided that 
an oxygen atmosphere of 5 pounds per square inch was the best engineering
compromise for a system that would permit extravehicular activity without another
module for an airlock. Other basic decisions included the selection of an onboard 
navigation system as well as the ground-based system, and controlled reentry to reduce
g-loads and give pinpoint landings. These original guidelines for lunar flight were 
presented to all NASA Centers and to the aerospace industry.

Maximum public embarrassment in the Mercury program occurred in
the inadvertent "tower flight". A circuit quirk cut off the Redstone's
engines inches after liftoff. It was just enough to trigger the escape
sequence. The engineers could explain it, but the public inevitably 
wondered if we were really ready to send a man safely into space.
</table>
</center>

<br>

The conceptual design of the moonship was done in two phases. The command
and service module evolved first as part of our circumlunar studies, and the lunar
lander was added later after the mode decision was made. We were extremely fortunate
that the design that evolved had such intrinsic merit. We had designed our circumlunar
spaceship to have a command module containing the flight crew located on top of the
stack, so that the astronauts could escape by means of an escape tower if abort were
necessary during launch. The service module containing fuel for space propulsion, elec-
tric power equipment, and other stores, was underneath it with its big rocket and its
maneuvering systems. In the adapter below the service module, a third element of the
spacecraft was located: a mission module to which the crew would transfer for special
experiments. Thus when the full landing mission came along, we were able to substitute
the lunar lander for this mission module. The turnaround, docking, and tunnel transfers 
between the command module and the lunar module were then the same ones that
we had planned between the command module and the mission module.
<br><br>
The shape of the command module was a refinement of the Mercury capsule,
optimized for the higher heating rate and the angles of attack required for controlled
reentry. (One must remember that at this early time, reentry was still considered a
serious problem.) Reentry from the Moon would generate heating rates twice as great
as those in vehicles returning at orbital speed. Experts had warned us that shock-wave
radiation would be an additional source of heating. Our studies showed that the blunt
body was still the optimum shape, although the afterbody shape should be more highly
tapered than in the Mercury capsule. As it turned out, our flights to the Moon showed
that the Apollo design was very conservative, particularly on the afterbody, and the
margins of safety for the astronauts in returning from the Moon were comfortably
large. Max Faget, Caldwell Johnson, and others of the Manned Spacecraft Center were
largely responsible for putting down the original lines of the Apollo command module.
They also suggested the internal arrangement.

Redstone rocket had launched Freedom
7. It reached top speed of 5180 miles
an hour on 302-mile trip. Astronaut and
capsule both landed in fine shape. Three
weeks later President Kennedy proposed
that U.S. astronauts go to the Moon in
next decade.

Mercury ended happily when a U.S.
Marine helicopter recovery team
plucked astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr.,
out of the sea to fly him to the carrier
Champlain on May 5, 1961.</table>

All during the early planning for the lunar missions, I had been greatly concerned
about the effects of solar radiation on the astronauts. Experts were not all in agreement
as to the amount of radiation that might be received on a mission to the Moon. I remember 
George Low stating that the normal shielding of the cabin walls, together with
the low probability of intense solar activity, would alleviate this hazard. He was right
and the radiation experienced by astronauts on trips to the Moon was of no medical
significance. Navigation in space might have been a serious problem had not Stark
Draper and his group at MIT gotten an early start. They were brought in under contract 
to devise a system for Apollo back in 1961. Working with their industrial partners, 
they produced a system that was amazingly accurate.
<br><br>
The pieces of the master plan were now beginning to fit together. In the fall of
1961, North American Aviation had won the contract for the Apollo command and
service module. The basic designs of the service propulsion engine, the reaction control
system, and the fuel cells were underway, but there were still major technical areas to
be settled. One of these was the launch-vehicle design. As a result of many studies, the
large rocket originally proposed had lost its backers. Dr. von Braun and the Huntsville
team were zeroing in on a rocket of intermediate size. This rocket was to use five of the
huge F-1 engines on the first stage and a new hydrogen-oxygen engine in the upper
stages. It could easily be sized to send more than 90,000 pounds on a course to the
Moon. We in Houston strongly supported this design, which was later called the Saturn
V. Only one rocket vehicle of this size would be required to send our spacecraft to the
Moon, if we used the lunar-orbit rendezvous technique. Getting official approval for
the lunar-orbit rendezvous was, however, to take considerable time and effort. Brainerd
Holmes, chosen by Webb to head Apollo in Washington, strongly favored Earth-orbit
rendezvous. This mode would use dual launchings of the huge Saturn V rockets, 
joining them together in orbit and pumping fuel from one to refill the other; and then 
realigning and lighting off that rocket to the Moon. In this way, much larger payloads
could be flown to the Moon than by a single rocket, but the technical and operational
problems seemed to me to be overwhelming.

John Glenn rounded the Earth three times
in Friendship 7, enjoyed his February 20,
1962, encounter with zero g, and wished his
capsule were glass so that he could see more.
Operations rnen on ground feared the heat
shield was not locked in place. Glenn, too,
had nervous moments and splashed his 
spacecraft into Atlantic 40 miles short of the 
projected area. Difficulties in controlling his
vehicle intensified engineers' drive for perfect
performances.</table>

A destroyer picked up Glenn's capsule in 17
minutes. He skinned his knuckles blowing the
hatch, and said that "it was hot in there". He
had lost weight but doctors' exhaustive tests
showed no adverse effects from his 4-hour
22-minute flight. City after city feted Glenn,
and his capsule was put in the Smithsonian
Institution near the Wright brothers' airplane.</table>

<br><br>

In contrast, I believed in and supported lunar-orbit rendezvous. In this mode, the
lander leaves the mother ship in lunar orbit and goes down to the Moon's surface.
Upon returning to lunar orbit, it links up with the mother ship and the astronauts
transfer to the command module and return to Earth for reentry and landing. Lunar-orbit 
rendezvous was espoused by John Houbolt, chairman of the group that studied
this plan at the Langley Research Center. When I heard of this plan, I was convinced
that this was the way to go. It required far less weight injected toward the Moon, but
even more important, in my view, was the fact that one spacecraft could be designed
specifically for lunar landing and takeoff, while the other could be designed for flying
to and from the Moon and specifically for reentry and Earth landing. An additional
bonus was that it allowed the tremendous industrial job to be divided between two
major contractors since there would be two spacecraft, thereby giving each one a more
manageable task.
<br><br>
By the late fall of 1961, all of us at the new Manned Spacecraft Center were unified 
in support of lunar-orbit rendezvous and were working tooth and nail to find out
all we could about lunar landers, rendezvousing, and the tradeoffs to be made. In
December of 1961 we made an earnest appeal to Brainerd Holmes to approve Lunar-orbit 
rendezvous. He could not be convinced at that time, however, and only six
months later was the final decision made. Much of the credit for selling the lunar-orbit
mode must be given to the Houston people. Charles Frick, who was our Apollo Spacecraft 
Manager at that time, was particularly effective. Studies conducted by Frick's
people converted first the key engineers at the Marshall Space Flight Center, including
Drs. Rees and von Braun, and, finally, Brainerd Holmes. Dr. Joe Shea, Holmes' assistant, 
then carried the decision on to higher echelons of the Government. Mr. Webb
approved the lunar-orbit plan and only Dr. Wiesner and a few others of the President's
Science Advisors remained unconvinced. However, the White House accepted Mr.
Webb's decision.
<br><br>
We were extremely fortunate during this period to have Brainerd Holmes in
charge of the Apollo program. He encouraged the key center leaders to work together
by establishing a management council with regular meetings. During these meetings,
we argued out our different opinions and developed into a management team. A less
skillful leader might have forced an early arbitrary decision that would have made the
whole task of getting to the Moon virtually impossible.
<br><br>
Our Administrator, Mr. Webb, now had a master plan. It consisted of the giant
three-stage launch vehicle, the Saturn V. There would be a command module with
three astronauts onboard. The command module would be a blunt body, properly
shaped and ballasted for controlled gliding reentry. It would use ablative material for
the heat shield and would land at sea with parachutes. A separate service module
would carry the space-propulsion engine, attitude-control jets, the fuel cells for electric
power, together with supplies of fuel and oxygen. There would be a lunar-landing
stage designed specifically for the job of landing on the Moon. It would carry two men
down to the Moon's surface and back to rendezvous with the mother ship in orbit. In
simple terms, this was the technical plan for Apollo, and it was to need no change as it
went forward in development. All of this had been decided within one year after the
President's announcement. Less than six months later, Grumman had won the 
contract to build the lunar lander.
<br><br>
One major element of basic program planning was still missing. How were we to
bridge the tremendous gap between the simple Mercury Earth-orbital program and the
Apollo voyage to the Moon? We needed a chance to train our men in many new elements 
of spaceflight, and we needed an engineering prototype for our ideas as well.
The answer was Project Gemini.
