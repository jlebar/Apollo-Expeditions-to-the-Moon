<h3>VIGILANCE AND JUDGMENT</h3>

"The accomplishments of this last Apollo mission and the successes of the previous
Apollo flights were the result of the dedicated efforts and the sacrifices of thousands of
individuals." I have difficulty recollecting how many times I stood on the platform
at Ellington Air Force Base welcoming the returning flight crews and heard those
words repeated. But they are nevertheless quite true. The people in Houston were with
their astronauts each step of the way. The interchange between Mike Collins, serving
as the CapCom (capsule communicator), and Bill Anders as Apollo 8 orbited the
Moon clearly demonstrated this feeling. Mike called Apollo 8, saying "Milt says we
are in a period of relaxed vigilance". Bill came back with "Very good. We relax; you
be vigilant." They came to rely on the controllers, as they well knew their very lives
depended on their vigilance and judgment. Mike later put it well in his book, Carrying
the Fire. He writes of the Gemini 10 reentry and their reliance on "Super Retro" John
Llewellyn. Mike says that they knew if they made a mistake John would be so angry
that he would stick up his strong Welsh arm and yank them out of the sky. John's
dominant personality is illustrated by the time he was coming on duty for his shift
in the Control Center and, finding his parking space taken, he simply parked on the
walk next to the door rather than waste time looking. Like his compatriots, John was
thoroughly dedicated. His type is at its best when fighting wars or flying missions.

Many individuals were involved in the building and testing of the spacecraft and
its systems, but once given the spacecraft and the necessary facilities and equipment,
the Apollo Operations Team was charged with the awesome responsibility for the
accomplishment of the mission. This team was composed of hundreds of 
individuals - government and contractor personnel, as 
well as representatives of the Department of
Defense and of foreign nations such as Australia and Spain. Each team member had
been carefully selected and subjected to countless hours of training and simulations;
each had also participated in Mercury, Gemini, or Apollo testing and flight operations. 
Time and time again, these young men had to rely on their technical knowledge
to assess the unexpected and determine the right course of action. The "luck" the
Operations Team had in overcoming adversity is exemplified by the words of University 
of Texas football coach Darrell Royal: "Luck is what happens when preparation
meets with opportunity". The luck of the Operations Team was the result of thorough
and careful planning and training and the development of both people and procedures.

Thinking back over the events of the past years, I realize the Operations Team
was always prepared when the opportunity presented itself. I'll certainly always remember 
their performance on Apollo 11. It takes an awful lot of events all going right
to get you to the Moon, let alone return. It was our first attempt at the landing and we
had somehow, incredibly, reached the point where we were starting the descent for the
landing. Thus far, all had gone astonishingly well. The first phase of the firing of the
lunar module engine went well as the descent started; and then, approximately five
minutes after ignition, the first of a series of computer alarms was received via telemetry
in the Mission Control Center and was also displayed to the crew onboard the lunar
module Eagle. I was responsible for the software in that computer, the logic that made
it all work. You can imagine the thoughts racing through my mind: Had we come all
this way for naught? What was wrong? The flight controller responsible for assessing
the problem, 27-year-old Steve Bales, was faced with an immediate decision: Should
we continue the descent or initiate an abort? An abort meant there would be no landing
for Apollo 11: we would have to try again. When Flight Director Gene Kranz pressed
him for his answer, young Mr. Bales' response was the loudest and most emphatic
"go" I have ever heard.
<br><br>
But it wasn't over yet. The lunar module was under automatic control as it
approached the surface. Neil realized that the automatic descent would terminate in
a boulder field surrounding a large rim crater. He took over control of the spacecraft
and steered the Eagle toward a smooth landing site. The low-level fuel light for the
engine came on, indicating about enough fuel for only 116 seconds of firing time on
the engine. With 45 seconds of fuel left, Eagle set down with a jolt and we were there.
