<h3>DETERMINING SATURN'S CONFIGURATION</h3>

The first launch of the Saturn booster was still five months away when, on May 25,
1961, President John F. Kennedy proposed that the United States commit itself to land
a man on the Moon "in this decade". For this ambitious task a launch vehicle far more
powerful than our eight-engine Saturn would be needed. To determine its exact power
requirements, a selection had to be made from among three operational concepts for a
manned voyage to the Moon: direct ascent, Earth orbit rendezvous (EOR), and lunar
orbit rendezvous (LOR).

Dr. von Braun, standing
next to one of the five engines at the after end of the
Saturn V vehicle's first stage
(on display at the Alabama
Space Museum), provides a
scale reference for the humain figures shown alongside two of the rockets in
the drawing below. The sequence of launch vehicles
of ever-increasing size and
power that led from the 46-foot-high V-2 rocket through
the Mercury and Gemini
boosters to the 363-foot
Saturn V is drawn here at a single scale.

With direct ascent, the entire spacecraft would soft-land on the Moon carrying
enough propellants to fly back to Earth. Weight and performance studies showed that
this would require a launch vehicle of a lift-off thrust of 12 million pounds, furnished by
eight F-1 engines. We called this hypothetical launch vehicle Nova. The EOR mode
envisioned two somewhat smaller rockets that were to rendezvous in Earth orbit where
their payloads would be combined. In the LOR mode a single rocket would launch a
payload consisting of a separable spacecraft toward the Moon, where an onboard propulsion 
unit would ease it into orbit. A two-stage lunar module (LM) would then
detach itself from the orbiting section and descend to the lunar surface. Its upper stage
would return to the circumlunar orbit for rendezvous with the orbiting section. In a
second burst of power, the propulsion unit would finally drive the reentry element with
its crew out of lunar orbit and back to Earth.
<br><br>

As all the world knows, the LOR mode was ultimately selected. But even after its
adoption, the number of F-1 engines to be used in the first stage of the Moon rocket
remained unresolved for quite a while. H.H. Koelle, who ran our Project Planning
Group at Marshall, had worked out detailed studies of a configuration called Saturn IV
with four F-l's, and another called Saturn V with five F-l's in its first stage. Uncertainty 
about LM weight and about propulsion performance of the still untested F-1
and upper-stage engines, combined with a desire to leave a margin for growth, finally
led us to the choice of the Saturn V configuration.

The stack: the three-stage launch vehicle, Saturn V,
surmounted by its payload, the Apollo spacecraft.
The greater part of the launch vehicle consists of
tankage for the fuel and for the oxidant, LOX
(liquid oxygen), used in all three Saturn V stages.
The powerful F-1 engines of the first stage burn
kerosene to produce a combined thrust of 7.5
million pounds. The fuel for the J-2 engines of the
two upper stages is liquid hydrogen. The combined
thrust of the second stage's five engines is just over
a million pounds, or five times that of the third
stage's single J-2 engine. Development of the original 
hydrogen tanks was difficult because the low
boiling point of hydrogen (-253 °C) required insulation 
sufficient to prevent transfer of heat from
the outside and the comparatively warm (-183 °C) liquid oxygen.
</table>

Despite the higher power offered by liquid hydrogen, Koelle's studies indicated
that little would be gained by using it in the first stage also, where it would have needed
disproportionately large tanks. (Liquid hydrogen is only one twelfth as dense as kerosene, 
so a much larger tank volume would have been required.) In all multistage rockets
the upper stages are lighter than the lower ones. Thus heavier but less energetic kerosene 
in the first stage, in combination with lighter but more powerful hydrogen in the
upper stages, made possible a better launch-vehicle configuration.
<br><br>
Saturn V, as it emerged from the studies, would consist of three stages-all brand
new. The first one, burning kerosene and oxygen, would be powered by five F-1 engines. 
We called it S-IC. The second stage, S-11, would need about a million pounds of
thrust and, if also powered by five engines, would call for the development of new
200,000-pound hydrogen-oxygen engines. A single engine of this thrust would just be
right to power the third stage. The Saturn l's S-IV second stage was clearly not powerful
enough to serve as the Saturn's third one. A much larger tankage and at least thirteen
of Pratt & Whitney's little LR-10 engines would be required; this did not appear very
attractive.
<br><br>
When bids for the new J-2 engine were solicited, Pratt & Whitney with its ample
liquid-hydrogen experience was a strong contender. But when all the points in the
sternly controlled bidding procedure were counted, North American's Rocketdyne 
Division won again.
<br><br>
North American had been involved in the development of liquid fuel rocket engines 
since the immediate postwar years and the Navajo long range ramjet program.
The engines it developed for the Navajo booster and their offspring later found their
way into the Atlas, Redstone, Thor, and Jupiter programs. For the testing of these
engines NAA's Rocketdyne Division had acquired a boulder-strewn area high in the
Santa Susana mountains, north of Los Angeles, that had previously served as rugged
background for many a Western movie. The Santa Susana facility would henceforth
serve not only for the development of the new J-2 engine, but also for short duration
"battleship" testing of the five-engine cluster of these engines powering the S-11 stage.
(Safety and noise considerations ruled out the use of Santa Susana for the 
1.5-million-pound-thrust F-1 engine. Test stands for its development were therefore set up in the
Mojave desert, adjacent to Edwards Air Force Base.)
